{"prompt": "Which OSI layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and interface standards? A. The Transport layer B. The Device layer C. The Physical layer D. The Data Link layer", "completion": "C. The Physical layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and standards that allow control of throughput, handling line noise, and a variety of other electrical interface and signaling requirements. The OSI layer doesn't have a Device layer. The Transport layer connects the Network and Session layers, and the Data Link layer packages packets from the network layer for transmission and receipt by devices operating on the Physical layer."}
{"prompt": "Ben is designing a Wi-Fi network and has been asked to choose the most secure option for the network. Which wireless security standard should he choose? A. WPA2 B. WPA C. WEP D. AES", "completion": "A. WPA2, the replacement for WPA, does not suffer from the security issues that WEP, the original wireless security protocol, and WPA, its successor, both suffer from. AES is used in WPA2 but is not specifically a wireless security standard."}
{"prompt": "If your organization needs to allow attachments in email to support critical business processes, what are the two best options for helping to avoid security problems caused by attachments? A. Train your users and use antimalware tools. B. Encrypt your email and use antimalware tools. C. Train your users and require S/MIME for all email. D. Use S/MIME by default and remove all ZIP (.zip) file attachments.", "completion": "A. User awareness is one of the most important tools when dealing with attachments. Attachments are often used as a vector for malware, and aware users can help prevent successful attacks by not opening the attachments. Antimalware tools, including antivirus software, can help detect known threats before users even see the attachments. Encryption, including tools like S/MIME, won't help prevent attachment-based security problems, and removing ZIP file attachments will only stop malware that is sent via those ZIP files."}
{"prompt": "Segmentation, sequencing, and error checking all occur at what layer of the OSI model that is associated with SSL, TLS, and UDP? A. The Transport layer B. The Network layer C. The Session layer D. The Presentation layer", "completion": "A. The Transport layer provides logical connections between devices, including end-toend transport services to ensure that data is delivered. Transport layer protocols include TCP, UDP, SSL, and TLS."}
{"prompt": "The Windows ipconfig command displays the following information: BC-5F-F4-7B-4B-7D What term describes this, and what information can usually be gathered from it? A. The IP address, the network location of the system B. The MAC address, the network interface card's manufacturer C. The MAC address, the media type in use D. The IPv6 client ID, the network interface card's manufacturer", "completion": "B. Machine Access Control (MAC) addresses are the hardware address the machine uses for layer 2 communications. The MAC addresses include an organizationally unique identifier (OUI), which identifies the manufacturer. MAC addresses can be changed, so this is not a guarantee of accuracy, but under normal circumstances you can tell what manufacturer made the device by using the MAC address."}
{"prompt": "Chris has been asked to choose between implementing PEAP and LEAP for wireless authentication. What should he choose, and why? A. LEAP, because it fixes problems with TKIP, resulting in stronger security B. PEAP, because it implements CCMP for security C. LEAP, because it implements EAP-TLS for end-to-end session encryption D. PEAP, because it can provide a TLS tunnel that encapsulates EAP methods, protecting the entire session", "completion": "D. PEAP provides encryption for EAP methods and can provide authentication. It does not implement CCMP, which was included in the WPA2 standard. LEAP is dangerously insecure and should not be used due to attack tools that have been available since the early 2000s."}
{"prompt": "Ben is troubleshooting a network and discovers that the NAT router he is connected to has the 192.168.x.x subnet as its internal network and that its external IP is 192.168.1.40. What problem is he encountering? A. 192.168.x.x is a nonroutable network and will not be carried to the Internet. B. 192.168.1.40 is not a valid address because it is reserved by RFC 1918. C. Double NATing is not possible using the same IP range. D. The upstream system is unable to de-encapsulate his packets and he needs to use PAT instead.", "completion": "C. Double NATing isn't possible with the same IP range; the same IP addresses cannot appear inside and outside a NAT router. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved, but only so they are not used and routable on the Internet, and changing to PAT would not fix the issue."}
{"prompt": "What is the default subnet mask for a Class B network? A. 255.0.0.0 B. 255.255.0.0 C. 255.254.0.0 D. 255.255.255.0", "completion": "B. A Class B network holds 2^16 systems, and its default network mask is 255.255.0.0."}
{"prompt": "Jim's organization uses a traditional PBX for voice communication. What is the most common security issue that its internal communications are likely to face, and what should he recommend to prevent it? A. Eavesdropping, encryption B. Man-in-the-middle attacks, end-to-end encryption C. Eavesdropping, physical security D. Wardialing, deploy an IPS", "completion": "C. Traditional private branch exchange (PBX) systems are vulnerable to eavesdropping because voice communications are carried directly over copper wires. Since standard telephones don't provide encryption (and you're unlikely to add encrypted phones unless you're the NSA), physically securing access to the lines and central connection points is the best strategy available."}
{"prompt": "What common security issue is often overlooked with cordless phones? A. Their signal is rarely encrypted and thus can be easily monitored. B. They use unlicensed frequencies. C. They can allow attackers access to wireless networks. D. They are rarely patched and are vulnerable to malware.", "completion": "A. Most cordless phones don't use encryption, and even modern phones that use DECT (which does provide encryption) have already been cracked. This means that a determined attacker can almost always eavesdrop on cordless phones, and makes them a security risk if they're used for confidential communication."}
{"prompt": "Lauren's organization has deployed VoIP phones on the same switches that the desktop PCs are on. What security issue could this create, and what solution would help? A. VLAN hopping; use physically separate switches. B. VLAN hopping; use encryption. C. Caller ID spoofing; MAC filtering. D. Denial of service attacks; use a firewall between networks.", "completion": "A. VLAN hopping between the voice and computer VLANs can be accomplished when devices share the same switch infrastructure. Using physically separate switches can prevent this attack. Encryption won't help with VLAN hopping because it relies on header data that the switch needs to read (and this is unencrypted), while Caller ID spoofing is an inherent problem with VoIP systems. A denial of service is always a possibility, but it isn't specifically a VoIP issue and a firewall may not stop the problem if it's on a port that must be allowed through."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following rules is not shown in the rulebase but will be enforced by the firewall? A. Stealth B. Implicit deny C. Connection proxy D. Egress filter", "completion": "B. All stateful inspection firewalls enforce an implicit deny rule as the final rule of the rulebase. It is designed to drop all inbound traffic that was not accepted by an earlier rule. Stealth rules hide the firewall from external networks, but they are not included by default. This firewall does not contain any egress filtering rules, and egress filtering is not enforced by default. Connection proxying is an optional feature of stateful inspection firewalls and would not be enforced without a rule explicitly implementing it."}
{"prompt": "What type of server is running at IP address 10.1.0.26? A. Email B. Web C. FTP D. Database", "completion": "A. SMTP uses ports 25 and 465. The presence of an inbound rule allowing SMTP traffic indicates that this is an email server."}
{"prompt": "The system at 15.246.10.1 attempts HTTP and HTTPS connections to the web server running at 10.1.0.50. Which one of the following statements is true about that connection? A. Both connections will be allowed. B. Both connections will be blocked. C. The HTTP connection will be allowed, and the HTTPS connection will be blocked. D. The HTTP connection will be blocked, and the HTTPS connection will be allowed.", "completion": "C. The HTTP connection will be allowed, despite the presence of rule #2, because it matches rule #1. The HTTPS connection will be blocked because there is no rule allowing HTTPS connections to this server."}
{"prompt": "What value should be used to fill in the source port for rule #3? A. 25 B. 465 C. 80 D. Any", "completion": "D. The firewall should be configured to accept inbound connections from any port selected by the source system. The vast majority of inbound firewall rules allow access from any source port."}
{"prompt": "Data streams occur at what three layers of the OSI model? A. Application, Presentation, and Session B. Presentation, Session, and Transport C. Physical, Data Link, and Network D. Data Link, Network, and Transport", "completion": "A. Data streams are associated with the Application, Presentation, and Session layers. Once they reach the Transport layer, they become segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). From there, they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer, and bits at the Physical layer."}
{"prompt": "Chris needs to design a firewall architecture that can support a DMZ, a database, and a private internal network in a secure manner that separates each function. What type of design should he use, and how many firewalls does he need? A. A four-tier firewall design with two firewalls B. A two-tier firewall design with three firewalls C. A three-tier firewall design with at least one firewall D. A single-tier firewall design with three firewalls", "completion": "C. A three-tier design separates three distinct protected zones and can be accomplished with a single firewall that has multiple interfaces. Single- and two-tier designs don't support the number of protected networks needed in this scenario, while a four-tier design would provide a tier that isn't needed."}
{"prompt": "Lauren's networking team has been asked to identify a technology that will allow them to dynamically change the organization's network by treating the network like code. What type of architecture should she recommend? A. A network that follows the 5-4-3 rule B. A converged network C. A software-defined network D. A hypervisor-based network", "completion": "C. Software-defined networking provides a network architecture that can be defined and configured as code or software. This will allow Lauren's team to quickly change the network based on organizational requirements. The 5-4-3 rule is an old design rule for networks that relied on repeaters or hubs. A converged network carries multiple types of traffic like voice, video, and data. A hypervisor-based network may be software defined, but it could also use traditional network devices running as virtual machines."}
{"prompt": "Cable modems, ISDN, and DSL are all examples of what type of technology? A. Baseband B. Broadband C. Digital D. Broadcast", "completion": "B. ISDN, cable modems, DSL, and T1 and T3 lines are all examples of broadband technology that can support multiple simultaneous signals. They are analog, not digital, and are not broadcast technologies."}
{"prompt": "What type of firewall design is shown in the following image? A. Single tier B. Two tier C. Three tier D. Next generation", "completion": "A. A single-tier firewall deployment is very simple and does not offer useful design options like a DMZ or separate transaction subnets."}
{"prompt": "During a review of her organization's network, Angela discovered that it was suffering from broadcast storms and that contractors, guests, and organizational administrative staff were on the same network segment. What design change should Angela recommend? A. Require encryption for all users. B. Install a firewall at the network border. C. Enable spanning tree loop detection. D. Segment the network based on functional requirements.", "completion": "D. Network segmentation can reduce issues with performance as well as diminish the chance of broadcast storms by limiting the number of systems in a segment. This decreases broadcast traffic visible to each system and can reduce congestion. Segmentation can also help provide security by separating functional groups who don't need to be able to access each other's systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and outbound traffic, not cross-network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues. Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm!"}
{"prompt": "ICMP, RIP, and network address translation all occur at what layer of the OSI model? A. Layer 1 B. Layer 2 C. Layer 3 D. Layer 4", "completion": "C. ICMP, RIP, and network address translation all occur at layer 3, the Network layer."}
{"prompt": "The IDS Ben is responsible for is used to monitor communications in the data center using a mirrored port on the data center switch. What traffic will Ben see once the majority of servers in the data center have been virtualized? A. The same traffic he currently sees B. All inter-VM traffic C. Only traffic sent outside the VM environment D. All inter-hypervisor traffic", "completion": "C. One of the visibility risks of virtualization is that communication between servers and systems using virtual interfaces can occur \"inside\" the virtual environment. This means that visibility into traffic in the virtualization environment has to be purpose-built as part of its design. Option D is correct but incomplete because inter-hypervisor traffic isn't the only traffic the IDS will see."}
{"prompt": "The VM administrators recommend enabling cut and paste between virtual machines. What security concern should Ben raise about this practice? A. It can cause a denial of service condition. B. It can serve as a covert channel. C. It can allow viruses to spread. D. It can bypass authentication controls.", "completion": "B. Cut and paste between virtual machines can bypass normal network-based data loss prevention tools and monitoring tools like an IDS or IPS. Thus, it can act as a covert channel, allowing the transport of data between security zones. So far, cut and paste has not been used as a method for malware spread in virtual environments and has not been associated with denial of service attacks. Cut and paste requires users to be logged in and does not bypass authentication requirements."}
{"prompt": "Ben is concerned about exploits that allow VM escape. What option should Ben suggest to help limit the impact of VM escape exploits? A. Separate virtual machines onto separate physical hardware based on task or data types. B. Use VM escape detection tools on the underlying hypervisor. C. Restore machines to their original snapshots on a regular basis. D. Use a utility like Tripwire to look for changes in the virtual machines.", "completion": "A. While virtual machine escape has only been demonstrated in laboratory environments, the threat is best dealt with by limiting what access to the underlying hypervisor can prove to a successful tracker. Segmenting by data types or access levels can limit the potential impact of a hypervisor compromise. If attackers can access the underlying system, restricting the breach to only similar data types or systems will limit the impact. Escape detection tools are not available on the market, restoring machines to their original snapshots will not prevent the exploit from occurring again, and Tripwire detects file changes and is unlikely to catch exploits that escape the virtual machines themselves."}
{"prompt": "WPA2's Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Mode Protocol (CCMP) is based on which common encryption scheme? A. DES B. 3DES C. AES D. TLS", "completion": "C. WPA2's CCMP encryption scheme is based on AES. As of the writing of this book, there have not been any practical real-world attacks against WPA2. DES has been successfully broken, and neither 3DES nor TLS is used for WPA2."}
{"prompt": "When a host on an Ethernet network detects a collision and transmits a jam signal, what happens next? A. The host that transmitted the jam signal is allowed to retransmit while all other hosts pause until that transmission is received successfully. B. All hosts stop transmitting, and each host waits a random period of time before attempting to transmit again. C. All hosts stop transmitting, and each host waits a period of time based on how recently it successfully transmitted. D. Hosts wait for the token to be passed and then resume transmitting data as they pass the token.", "completion": "B. Ethernet networks use Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/ CD) technology. When a collision is detected and a jam signal is sent, hosts wait a random period of time before attempting retransmission."}
{"prompt": "What is the speed of a T3 line? A. 128 kbps B. 1.544 Mbps C. 44.736 Mbps D. 155 Mbps", "completion": "C. A T3 (DS-3) line is capable of 44.736 Mbps. This is often referred to as 45 Mbps. A T1 is 1.544 Mbps, ATM is 155 Mbps, and ISDN is often 64 or 128 Kbps."}
{"prompt": "What type of firewall design does the following image show? A. A single-tier firewall B. A two-tier firewall C. A three-tier firewall D. A fully protected DMZ firewall", "completion": "B. A two-tier firewall uses a firewall with multiple interfaces or multiple firewalls in series. This image shows a firewall with two protected interfaces, with one used for a DMZ and one used for a protected network. This allows traffic to be filtered between each of the zones (Internet, DMZ, and private network)."}
{"prompt": "What challenge is most common for endpoint security system deployments? A. Compromises B. The volume of data C. Monitoring encrypted traffic on the network D. Handling non-TCP protocols", "completion": "B. Endpoint security solutions face challenges due to the sheer volume of data that they can create. When each workstation is generating data about events, this can be a massive amount of data. Endpoint security solutions should reduce the number of compromises when properly implemented, and they can also help by monitoring traffic after it is decrypted on the local host. Finally, non-TCP protocols are relatively uncommon on modern networks, making this a relatively rare concern for endpoint security system implementations."}
{"prompt": "What type of address is 127.0.0.1? A. A public IP address B. An RFC 1918 address C. An APIPA address D. A loopback address", "completion": "D. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address and will resolve to the local machine. Public addresses are non-RFC 1918, non-reserved addresses. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved and include ranges like 10.x.x.x. An APIPA address is a self-assigned address used when a DHCP server cannot be found."}
{"prompt": "Susan is writing a best practices statement for her organizational users who need to use Bluetooth. She knows that there are many potential security issues with Bluetooth and wants to provide the best advice she can. Which of the following sets of guidance should Susan include? A. Use Bluetooth's built-in strong encryption, change the default PIN on your device, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. B. Use Bluetooth only for those activities that are not confidential, change the default PIN on your device, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. C. Use Bluetooth's built-in strong encryption, use extended (8 digit or longer) Bluetooth PINs, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. D. Use Bluetooth only for those activities that are not confidential, use extended (8 digit or longer) Bluetooth PINs, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use.", "completion": "B. Since Bluetooth doesn't provide strong encryption, it should only be used for activities that are not confidential. Bluetooth PINs are four-digit codes that often default to 0000. Turning it off and ensuring that your devices are not in discovery mode can help prevent Bluetooth attacks."}
{"prompt": "What type of networking device is most commonly used to assign endpoint systems to VLANs? A. Firewall B. Router C. Switch D. Hub", "completion": "C. The assignment of endpoint systems to VLANs is normally performed by a network switch."}
{"prompt": "Steve has been tasked with implementing a network storage protocol over an IP network. What storage-centric converged protocol is he likely to use in his implementation? A. MPLS B. FCoE C. SDN D. VoIP", "completion": "B. Fibre Channel over Ethernet allows Fibre Channel communications over Ethernet networks, allowing existing high-speed networks to be used to carry storage traffic. This avoids the cost of a custom cable plant for a Fibre Channel implementation. MPLS, or Multiprotocol Label Switching, is used for high performance networking; VoIP is Voice over IP; and SDN is software-defined networking."}
{"prompt": "What type of network device modulates between an analog carrier signal and digital information for computer communications? A. A bridge B. A router C. A brouter D. A modem", "completion": "D. A modem (MOdulator/DEModulator) modulates between an analog carrier like a phone line and digital communications like those used between computers. While modems aren't in heavy use in most areas, they are still in place for system control and remote system contact and in areas where phone lines are available but other forms of communication are too expensive or not available."}
{"prompt": "A denial of service (DoS) attack that sends fragmented TCP packets is known as what kind of attack? A. Christmas tree B. Teardrop C. Stack killer D. Frag grenade", "completion": "B. A teardrop attack uses fragmented packets to target a flaw in how the TCP stack on a system handles fragment reassembly. If the attack is successful, the TCP stack fails, resulting in a denial of service. Christmas tree attacks set all of the possible TCP flags on a packet, thus \"lighting it up like a Christmas tree.\" Stack killer and frag grenade attacks are made-up answers."}
{"prompt": "Phillip maintains a modem bank in support of several legacy services used by his organization. Which one of the following protocols is most appropriate for this purpose? A. SLIP B. SLAP C. PPTP D. PPP", "completion": "D. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is used for dial-up connections for modems, IDSN, Frame Relay, and other technologies. It replaced SLIP in almost all cases. PPTP is the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol used for VPNs, and SLAP is not a protocol at all!"}
{"prompt": "One of the findings that Jim made when performing a security audit was the use of non-IP protocols in a private network. What issue should Jim point out that may result from the use of these non-IP protocols? A. They are outdated and cannot be used on modern PCs. B. They may not be able to be filtered by firewall devices. C. They may allow Christmas tree attacks. D. IPX extends on the IP protocol and may not be supported by all TCP stacks.", "completion": "B. While non-IP protocols like IPX/SPX, NetBEUI, and AppleTalk are rare in modern networks, they can present a challenge because many firewalls are not capable of filtering them. This can create risks when they are necessary for an application or system's function  because they may have to be passed without any inspection. Christmas tree attacks set all of the possible flags on a TCP packet (and are thus related to an IP protocol), IPX is not an IP-based protocol, and while these protocols are outdated, there are ways to make even modern PCs understand them."}
{"prompt": "Angela needs to choose between EAP, PEAP, and LEAP for secure authentication. Which authentication protocol should she choose and why? A. EAP, because it provides strong encryption by default B. LEAP, because it provides frequent reauthentication and changing of WEP keys C. PEAP, because it provides encryption and doesn't suffer from the same vulnerabilities that LEAP does D. None of these options can provide secure authentication, and an alternate solution should be chosen.", "completion": "C. Of the three answers, PEAP is the best solution. It encapsulates EAP in a TLS tunnel, providing strong encryption. LEAP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that was originally designed to help deal with problems in WEP. LEAP's protections have been defeated, making it a poor choice."}
{"prompt": "Lauren has been asked to replace her organization's PPTP implementation with an L2TP implementation for security reasons. What is the primary security reason that L2TP would replace PPTP? A. L2TP can use IPsec. B. L2TP creates a point-to-point tunnel, avoiding multipoint issues. C. PPTP doesn't support EAP. D. PPTP doesn't properly encapsulate PPP packets.", "completion": "A. L2TP can use IPsec to provide encryption of traffic, ensuring confidentiality of the traffic carried via an L2TP VPN. PPTP sends the initial packets of a session in plaintext, potentially including usernames and hashed passwords. PPTP does support EAP and was designed to encapsulate PPP packets. All VPNs are point to point, and multipoint issues are not a VPN problem."}
{"prompt": "Jim is building a research computing system that benefits from being part of a full mesh topology between systems. In a five-node full mesh topology design, how many connections will an individual node have? A. Two B. Three C. Four D. Five", "completion": "C. A full mesh topology directly connects each machine to every other machine on the network. For five systems, this means four connections per system."}
{"prompt": "What topology correctly describes Ethernet? A. A ring B. A star C. A mesh D. A bus", "completion": "D. Ethernet uses a bus topology. While devices may be physically connected to a switch in a physical topology that looks like a star, systems using Ethernet can all transmit on the bus simultaneously, possibly leading to collisions."}
{"prompt": "What type of attack is most likely to occur after a successful ARP spoofing attempt? A. A DoS attack B. A Trojan C. A replay attack D. A man-in-the-middle attack", "completion": "D. ARP spoofing is often done to replace a target's cache entry for a destination IP, allowing the attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. A denial of service attack would be aimed at disrupting services rather than spoofing an ARP response, a replay attack will involve existing sessions, and a Trojan is malware that is disguised in a way that makes it look harmless."}
{"prompt": "What speed is Category 3 UTP cable rated for? A. 5 Mbps B. 10 Mbps C. 100 Mbps D. 1000 Mbps", "completion": "B. Category 3 UTP cable is primarily used for phone cables and was also used for early Ethernet networks where it provided 10 Mbps of throughput. Cat 5 cable provides 100 Mbps (and 1000 Mbps if it is Cat 5e). Cat 6 cable can also provide 1000 Mbps."}
{"prompt": "What issue occurs when data transmitted over one set of wires is picked up by another set of wires? A. Magnetic interference B. Crosstalk C. Transmission absorption D. Amplitude modulation", "completion": "B. Crosstalk occurs when data transmitted on one set of wires is picked up on another set of wires. Interference like this is electromagnetic rather than simply magnetic, transmission absorption is a made-up term, and amplitude modulation is how AM radio works."}
{"prompt": "What two key issues with the implementation of RC4 make Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) even weaker than it might otherwise be? A. Its use of a static common key and client-set encryption algorithms B. Its use of a static common key and a limited number of initialization vectors C. Its use of weak asymmetric keys and a limited number of initialization vectors D. Its use of a weak asymmetric key and client-set encryption algorithms", "completion": "B. WEP's implementation of RC4 is weakened by its use of a static common key and a limited number of initialization vectors. It does not use asymmetric encryption, and clients do not select encryption algorithms."}
{"prompt": "Chris is setting up a hotel network and needs to ensure that systems in each room or suite can connect to each other, but systems in other suites or rooms cannot. At the same time, he needs to ensure that all systems in the hotel can reach the internet. What solution should he recommend as the most effective business solution? A. Per-room VPNs B. VLANs C. Port security D. Firewalls", "completion": "B. VLANs can be used to logically separate groups of network ports while still providing access to an uplink. Per-room VPNs would create significant overhead for support as well as create additional expenses. Port security is used to limit what systems can connect to ports, but it doesn't provide network security between systems. Finally, while firewalls might work, they would add additional expense and complexity without adding any benefits over a VLAN solution."}
{"prompt": "During a forensic investigation, Charles is able to determine the Media Access Control address of a system that was connected to a compromised network. Charles knows that MAC addresses are tied back to a manufacturer or vendor and are part of the fingerprint of the system. To which OSI layer does a MAC address belong? A. The Application layer B. The Session layer C. The Physical layer D. The Data Link layer", "completion": "D. MAC addresses and their organizationally unique identifiers are used at the Data Link layer to identify systems on a network. The Application and Session layers don't care about physical addresses, while the Physical layer involves electrical connectivity and handling physical interfaces rather than addressing."}
{"prompt": "Ben knows that his organization wants to be able to validate the identity of other organizations based on their domain name when receiving and sending email. What tool should Ben recommend? A. PEM B. S/MIME C. DKIM D. MOSS", "completion": "C. Domain Keys Identified Mail, or DKIM, is designed to allow assertions of domain identity to validate email. S/MIME, PEM, and MOSS are all solutions that can provide authentication, integrity, nonrepudiation, and confidentiality, depending on how they are used."}
