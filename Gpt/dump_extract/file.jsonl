{"prompt": "Susan is setting up the network for a local coffee house and wants to ensure that users have to authenticate using an email address and agree to the coffee house's acceptable use policy before being allowed on the network. What technology should she use to do this? A. 802.11 B. NAC C. A captive portal D. A wireless gateway", "completion": "C. Captive portals are designed to show a page that can require actions like accepting an agreement or recording an email address before connecting clients to the Internet. NAC is designed to verify whether clients meet a security profile, which doesn't match the needs of most coffee shops. A wireless gateway is a tool to access a cellular or other network, rather than a way to interact with users before they connect, and 802.11 is the family of IEEE wireless standards."}
{"prompt": "What is another term for active monitoring? A. Synthetic B. Passive C. Reactive D. Span-based", "completion": "A. Active monitoring is also known as synthetic monitoring and relies on prerecorded or generated traffic to test systems for performance and other issues. Passive monitoring uses span ports, network taps, or similar technologies to capture actual traffic for analysis. Reactive monitoring is not a commonly used industry term."}
{"prompt": "The TCP header is made up of elements such as the source port, destination port, sequence number, and others. How many bytes long is the TCP header? A. 8 bytes B. 20 to 60 bytes C. 64 bytes D. 64 to 128 bytes", "completion": "B. TCP headers can be 20 to 60 bytes long depending on options that are set."}
{"prompt": "What security considerations should Fred's company require for sending sensitive data over the cellular network? A. They should use the same requirements as data over any public network. B. Cellular provider networks are private networks and should not require special consideration. C. Encrypt all traffic to ensure confidentiality. D. Require the use of WAP for all data sent from the phone.", "completion": "A. Cellular networks have the same issues that any public network does. Encryption requirements should match those that the organization selects for other public networks like hotels, conference Wi-Fi, and similar scenarios. Encrypting all data is difficult and adds overhead, so it should not be the default answer unless the company specifically requires it. WAP is a dated wireless application protocol and is not in broad use; requiring it would be difficult. WAP does provide TLS, which would help when in use."}
{"prompt": "Fred intends to attend a major hacker conference this year. What should he do when connecting to his cellular provider's 4G network while at the conference? A. Continue normal usage. B. Discontinue all usage; towers can be spoofed. C. Only use trusted Wi-Fi networks. D. Connect to his company's encrypted VPN service", "completion": "D. Fred's best option is to use an encrypted, trusted VPN service to tunnel all of his data usage. Trusted Wi-Fi networks are unlikely to exist at a hacker conference, normal usage is dangerous due to the proliferation of technology that allows fake towers to be set up, and discontinuing all usage won't support Fred's business needs."}
{"prompt": "What are the most likely circumstances that would cause a remote wipe of a mobile phone to fail? A. The phone has a passcode on it. B. The phone cannot contact a network. C. The provider has not unlocked the phone. D. The phone is in use.", "completion": "B. Remote wipe tools are a useful solution, but they only work if the phone can access either a cellular or Wi-Fi network. Remote wipe solutions are designed to wipe data from the phone regardless of whether it is in use or has a passcode. Providers unlock phones for use on other cellular networks rather than for wiping or other feature support."}
{"prompt": "Elaine is developing a business continuity plan for her organization. What value should she seek to minimize? A. AV B. SSL C. RTO D. MTO", "completion": "C. The goal of business continuity planning exercises is to reduce the amount of time required to restore operations. This is done by minimizing the recovery time objective (RTO)."}
{"prompt": "NIST Special Publication 800-53, revision 4, describes two measures of assurance. Which measure of developmental assurance is best described as measuring \"the rigor, level of detail, and formality of the artifacts produced during the design and development of the hardware, software, and firmware components of information systems (e.g., functional specifications, high-level design, low-level design, source code)\"? A. Coverage B. Suitability C. Affirmation D. Depth", "completion": "D. NIST Special Publication 800-53 describes depth and coverage. Depth is the level of detail, rigor, and formality of artifacts produced during design and development. Coverage is the breadth and scope of the assessment conducted. If you encounter a question like this and are not familiar with the details of a standard like NIST 800-53, or may not remember them, focus on the meanings of each word and the details of the question. We can easily rule out affirmation, which isn't a measure. Suitability is a possibility, but depth fits better than suitability or coverage."}

Checklist review B. Parallel test C. Tabletop exercise D. Full interruption Test"}
{"prompt": "Chris is experiencing issues with the quality of network service on his organization's network. The primary symptom is that packets are becoming corrupted as they travel from their source to their destination. What term describes the issue Chris is facing? A. Latency B. Jitter C. Interference D. Packet loss", "completion": "C. Interference is electrical noise or other disruptions that corrupt the contents of packets. Latency is a delay in the delivery of packets from their source to their destination. Jitter is a variation in the latency for different packets. Packet loss is the disappearance of packets in transit that requires retransmission."}
{"prompt": "Kathleen has been asked to choose a highly formalized code review process for her software quality assurance team to use. Which of the following software testing processes is the most rigorous and formal? A. Fagan B. Fuzzing C. Over the shoulder D. Pair programming", "completion": "A. Fagan inspections follow a rigorous, highly structured process to perform code review, using a planning, overview, preparation, inspection, rework, and follow-up cycle. Fuzzing feeds unexpected input to programs, while over-the-shoulder code review is simply a review by having another developer meet with them to review code using a walk-through. Pair programming uses a pair of developers, one of whom writes code while both talk through the coding and development process."}
{"prompt": "Frank is attempting to protect his web application against cross-site scripting attacks. Users do not need to provide input containing scripts, so he decided the most effective way to filter would be to write a filter on the server that watches for the <SCRIPT> tag and removes it. What is the issue with Frank's approach? A. Validation should always be performed on the client side. B. Attackers may use XSS filter evasion techniques against this approach. C. Server-side validation requires removing all HTML tags, not just the <SCRIPT> tag. D. There is no problem with Frank's approach.", "completion": "B. While removing the <SCRIPT> tag from user input, it is not sufficient, as a user may easily evade this filter by encoding the tag with an XSS filter evasion technique. Frank was correct to perform validation on the server rather than at the client, but he should use validation that limits user input to allowed values, rather than filtering out one potentially malicious tag."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following is not an object-oriented programming language? A. C++ B. Java C. Fortran D. C#", "completion": "C. Fortran is a functional programming language. Java, C++, and C# are all objectoriented languages, meaning that they use the object model and approach programming as describing the interactions between objects."}
{"prompt": "Uptown Records Management recently entered into a contract with a hospital for the secure storage of medical records. The hospital is a HIPAA-covered entity. What type of agreement must the two organizations sign to remain compliant with HIPAA? A. NDA B. NCA C. BAA D. SLA", "completion": "C. HIPAA requires that anyone working with personal health information on behalf of a HIPAA-covered entity be subject to the terms of a business associates agreement (BAA)."}
{"prompt": "Norm would like to conduct a disaster recovery test for his organization and wants to choose the most thorough type of test, recognizing that it may be quite disruptive. What type of test should Norm choose? A. Full interruption test B. Parallel test C. Tabletop exercise D. Checklist review", "completion": "A. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing but the primary site remains operational. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems."}
{"prompt": "Ed is building a network that supports IPv6 but needs to connect it to an IPv4 network. What type of device should Ed place between the networks? A. A switch B. A router C. A bridge D. A gateway", "completion": "D. Ed's best option is to install an IPv6 to IPv4 gateway that can translate traffic between the networks. A bridge would be appropriate for different types of networks, whereas a router would make sense if the networks were similar. A modern switch might be able to carry both types of traffic but wouldn't be much help translating between the two protocols."}

{"prompt": "Tammy is selecting a disaster recovery facility for her organization. She would like to choose a facility that balances the time required to recover operations with the cost involved. What type of facility should she choose? A. Hot site B. Warm site C. Cold site D. Red site", "completion": "B. Tammy should choose a warm site. This type of facility meets her requirements for a good balance between cost and recovery time. It is less expensive than a hot site but facilitates faster recovery than a cold site. A red site is not a type of disaster recovery facility."}
{"prompt": "What layer of the OSI model is associated with datagrams? A. Session B. Transport C. Network D. Data Link", "completion": "B. When data reaches the Transport layer, it is sent as segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). Above the Transport layer, data becomes a data stream, while below the Transport layer they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer, and bits at the Physical layer."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following is not a valid key length for the Advanced Encryption Standard? A. 128 bits B. 192 bits C. 256 bits D. 384 bits", "completion": "D. The Advanced Encryption Standard supports encryption with 128-bit keys, 192-bit keys, and 256-bit keys."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following technologies provides a function interface that allows developers to directly interact with systems without knowing the implementation details of that system? A. Data dictionary B. Object model C. Source code D. API", "completion": "D. An application programming interface (API) allows developers to create a direct method for other users to interact with their systems through an abstraction that does not require knowledge of the implementation details. Access to object models, source code, and data dictionaries also indirectly facilitate interaction but do so in a manner that provides other developers with implementation details."}
{"prompt": "When Ben lists the files on a Linux system, he sees a set of attributes as shown in the following image. The letters rwx indicate different levels of what? A. Identification B. Authorization C. Authentication D. Accountability", "completion": "B. The permissions granted on files in Linux designate what authorized users can do with those files-read, write, or execute. In the image shown, all users can read, write, and execute index.html, whereas the owner can read, write, and execute example.txt, the group cannot, and everyone can write and execute it."}
