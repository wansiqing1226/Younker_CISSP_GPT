The key process areas for this level include Requirements Management, Software Project Planning, Software Project Tracking and Oversight, Software Subcontract Management, Software Quality Assurance, and Software Configuration Management. Software Quality Management is a process that occurs during level 4, the Managed stage of the SW-CMM."}
{"prompt": "Ben wants to provide predictive information about his organization's risk exposure in an automated way as part of an ongoing organizational risk management plan. What should he use to do this? A. KRIs B. Quantitative risk assessments C. KPIs D. Penetration tests", "completion": "A. Key risk indicators (KRIs) are often used to monitor risk for organizations that establish an ongoing risk management program. Using automated data gathering and tools that allow data to be digested and summarized can provide predictive information about how organizational risks are changing. KPIs are key performance indicators, which are used to assess how an organization is performing. Quantitative risk assessments are good for point-in-time views with detailed valuation and measurement-based risk assessments, whereas a penetration test would provide details of how well an organization's security controls are working."}
{"prompt": "In the image shown here, what does system B send to system A at step 2 of the three-way TCP handshake? A. SYN B. ACK C. FIN/ACK D. SYN/ACK", "completion": "D. The three-way handshake is SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK. System B should respond with \"Synchronize and Acknowledge\" to System A after it receives a SYN."}
{"prompt": "Chris is conducting reconnaissance on a remote target and discovers that pings are allowed through his target's border firewall. What can he learn by using ping to probe the remote network? A. Which systems respond to ping, a rough network topology, and potentially the location of additional firewalls B. A list of all of the systems behind the target's firewall C. The hostnames and time to live (TTL) for each pingable system, and the ICMP types allowed through the firewall D. Router advertisements, echo request responses, and potentially which hosts are tarpitted", "completion": "A. Systems that respond to ping will show the time to live for packets that reach them. Since TTL is decremented at each hop, this can help build a rough network topology map. In addition, some firewalls respond differently to ping than a normal system, which means pinging a network can sometimes reveal the presence of firewalls that would otherwise be invisible. Hostnames are revealed by a DNS lookup, and ICMP types allowed through a firewall are not revealed by only performing a ping. ICMP can be used for router advertisements, but pinging won't show them!"}
{"prompt": "What access management concept defines what rights or privileges a user has? A. Identification B. Accountability C. Authorization D. Authentication", "completion": "C. Authorization defines what a subject can or can't do. Identification occurs when a subject claims an identity, accountability is provided by the logs and audit trail that track what occurs on a system, and authorization occurs when that identity is validated."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following is not a classification level commonly found in commercial data classification schemes? A. Secret B. Sensitive C. Confidential D. Public", "completion": "A. The commercial classification scheme discussed by (ISC)2 includes four primary classification levels: confidential, private, sensitive, and public. Secret is a part of the military classification scheme."}
{"prompt": "Files, databases, computers, programs, processes, devices, and media are all examples of what? A. Subjects B. Objects C. File stores D. Users", "completion": "B. All of these are objects. Although some of these items can be subjects, files, databases, and storage media can't be. Processes and programs aren't file stores, and of course none of these are users."}
{"prompt": "Danielle is testing tax software, and part of her testing process requires her to input a variety of actual tax forms to verify that the software produces the right answers. What type of testing is Danielle performing? A. Use case testing B. Dynamic testing C. Fuzzing D. Misuse testing", "completion": "A. Testing for desired functionality is use case testing. Dynamic testing is used to determine how code handles variables that change over time. Misuse testing focuses on how code handles examples of misuse, and fuzzing feeds unexpected data as an input to see how the code responds."}
{"prompt": "After 10 years working in her organization, Cassandra is moving into her fourth role, this time as a manager in the accounting department. What issue is likely to show up during an account review if her organization does not have strong account maintenance practices? A. An issue with least privilege B. Privilege creep C. Account creep D. Account termination", "completion": "B. Privilege creep is a common problem when employees change roles over time and their privileges and permissions are not properly modified to reflect their new roles. Least privilege issues are a design or implementation problem, and switching roles isn't typically what causes them to occur. Account creep is not a common industry term, and account termination would imply that someone has removed her account instead of switching her to new groups or new roles."}
{"prompt": "IP addresses like 10.10.10.10 and 172.19.24.21 are both examples of what type of IP address? A. Public IP addresses B. Prohibited IP addresses C. Private IP addresses D. Class B IP ranges", "completion": "C. These are examples of private IP addresses. RFC1918 defines a set of private IP addresses for use in internal networks. These private addresses including 10.0.0.0 to 255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 196.168.255.255 should never be routable on the public Internet."}
{"prompt": "What flaw is a concern with preset questions for cognitive passwords? A. It prevents the use of tokens. B. The question's answer may be easy to find on the Internet. C. Cognitive passwords require users to think to answer the question, and not all users may be able to solve the problems presented. D. Cognitive passwords don't support long passwords.", "completion": "B. A cognitive password authenticates users based on a series of facts or answers to questions that they know. Preset questions for cognitive passwords typically rely on common information about a user like their mother's maiden name or the name of their pet, and that information can frequently be found on the Internet. The best cognitive password systems let users make up their own questions."}
{"prompt": "Megan needs to create a forensic copy of a hard drive that will be used in an investigation. Which of the following tools is best suited to her work? A. xcopy B. dd C. DBAN D. ImageMagik", "completion": "B. The Linux tool dd creates a bit-by-bit copy of the target drive that is well suited to forensic use, and special forensic versions of dd exist that can provide even more forensic features. Simply copying files using a tool like xcopy does not create a forensically sound copy. DBAN is a drive wiping tool and would cause Megan to lose the data she is seeking to copy. ImageMagik is a graphics manipulation and editing program."}
{"prompt": "Kay is selecting an application management approach for her organization. Employees need the flexibility to install software on their systems, but Kay wants to prevent them from installing certain prohibited packages. What type of approach should she use? A. Antivirus B. Whitelist C. Blacklist D. Heuristic", "completion": "C. The blacklist approach to application control blocks certain prohibited packages but allows the installation of other software on systems. The whitelist approach uses the reverse philosophy and only allows approved software. Antivirus software would only detect the installation of malicious software after the fact. Heuristic detection is a variant of antivirus software."}
{"prompt": "Data relating to the past, present, or future payment for the provision of healthcare to an individual is what type of data per HIPAA? A. PCI B. Personal billing data C. PHI D. Personally identifiable information (PII)", "completion": "C. Personal health information (PHI) is specifically defined by HIPAA to include information about an individual's medical bills. PCI could refer to the payment card industry's security standard but would only apply in relation to credit cards. PII is a broadly defined term for personally identifiable information, and personal billing data isn't a broadly used industry term."}
{"prompt": "Yagis, panel, cantennas, and parabolic antennas are all examples of what type of antenna? A. Omnidirectional B. Rubber duck or base antenna C. Signal boosting D. Directional", "completion": "D. Yagis, panel antennas, cantennas, and parabolic antennas are all types of directional antennas. Omnidirectional antennas radiate in all directions, whereas these types of antennas are not necessarily signal boosting. Finally, rubber duck antennas are a type of omnidirectional pole antenna."}
{"prompt": "While traveling, James is held at knifepoint and forced to log into his laptop. What is this called? A. Duress B. Antisocial engineering C. Distress D. Knifepoint hacking", "completion": "A. When someone is forced to perform an action under threat, it is known as duress."}

How many files will be copied in Wednesday's backup? A. 1 B. 2 C. 5 D. 6", "completion": "B. In this scenario, all of the files on the server will be backed up on Monday evening during the full backup. Tuesday's incremental backup will include all files changed since Monday's full backup: files 1, 2, and 5. Wednesday's incremental backup will then include all files modified since Tuesday's incremental backup: files 3 and 6."}
{"prompt": "Susan uses a span port to monitor traffic to her production website and uses a monitoring tool to identify performance issues in real time. What type of monitoring is she conducting? A. Passive monitoring B. Active monitoring C. Synthetic monitoring D. Signature-based monitoring", "completion": "A. Susan is performing passive monitoring, which uses a network tap or span port to capture traffic to analyze it without impacting the network or devices that it is used to monitor. Synthetic, or active, monitoring uses recorded or generated traffic to test for performance and other issues. Signature-based technologies include IDS, IPS, and antimalware systems."}
{"prompt": "The type of access granted to an object and the actions that you can take on or with the object are examples of what? A. Permissions B. Rights C. Privileges D. Roles", "completion": "A. While the differences between rights, permissions, and roles can be confusing, typically permissions include both the access and actions that you can take on an object. Rights usually refer to the ability to take action on an object and don't include the access to it. Privileges combine rights and permissions, and roles describe sets of privileges based on job tasks or other organizational artifacts."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following would be considered an example of infrastructure as a service cloud computing? A. Payroll system managed by a vendor and delivered over the web B. Application platform managed by a vendor that runs customer code C. Servers provisioned by customers on a vendor-managed virtualization platform D. Web-based email service provided by a vendor", "completion": "C. One of the core capabilities of infrastructure as a service is providing servers on a vendor-managed virtualization platform. Web-based payroll and email systems are examples of software as a service. An application platform managed by a vendor that runs customer code is an example of platform as a service."}
{"prompt": "Based on the information in this scenario, what is the exposure factor for the effect of a fire on the Roscommon Agricultural Products data center? A. 7.5% B. 15.0% C. 27.5% D. 37.5%", "completion": "D. The exposure factor is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. In this case, that is $750,000 in damage divided by the $2 million facility value, or 37.5%."}
{"prompt": "Based on the information in this scenario, what is the annualized rate of occurrence for a fire at the Roscommon Agricultural Products data center? A. 0.002 B. 0.005 C. 0.02 D. 0.05", "completion": "C. The annualized rate of occurrence is the number of times each year that risk analysts expect a risk to happen. In this case, the analysts expect fires will occur once every 50 years, or 0.02 times per year."}
{"prompt": "Based on the information in this scenario, what is the annualized loss expectancy for a fire at the Roscommon Agricultural Products data center? A. $15,000 B. $25,000 C. $75,000 D. $750,000", "completion": "A. The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $750,000, and the ARO is 0.02. Multiplying these numbers together gives you the ALE of $15,000."}
{"prompt": "Two TCP header flags are rarely used. Which two are you unlikely to see in use in a modern network? A. CWR and ECE B. URG and FIN C. ECE and RST D. CWR and URG", "completion": "A. Congestion Window Reduced (CWR) and ECN-Echo (ECE) are used to manage transmission over congested links and are rarely seen in modern TCP networks."}
{"prompt": "Mike wants to ensure that third-party users of his service's API can be tracked to prevent abuse of the API. What should he implement to help with this? A. Session IDs B. An API firewall C. API keys D. An API buffer", "completion": "C. API keys, or application programming interface keys, are passed to services and identify the program, developer, or user. With this information, Mike can programmatically control API usage per user. Of course, if the keys are inadvertently exposed, the API keys themselves could be abused. Session IDs are typically used to identify users of an application, not an API. API firewalls and API buffers were made up for this question."}
{"prompt": "Fran is a web developer who works for an online retailer. Her boss asked her to create a way that customers can easily integrate themselves with Fran's company's site. They need to be able to check inventory in real time, place orders, and check order status programmatically without having to access the web page. What can Fran create to most directly facilitate this interaction? A. API B. Web scraper C. Data dictionary D. Call center", "completion": "A. An application programming interface (API) allows external users to directly call routines within Fran's code. They can embed API calls within scripts and other programs to automate interactions with Fran's company. A web scraper or call center might facilitate the same tasks, but they do not do so in a direct integration. Data dictionaries might provide useful information, but they also do not allow direct integration."}
{"prompt": "What type of power issue occurs when a facility experiences a momentary loss of power? A. Fault B. Blackout C. Sag D. Brownout", "completion": "A. A fault is a momentary loss of power. Blackouts are sustained complete losses of power. Sags and brownouts are not complete power disruptions but rather periods of low-voltage conditions."}
{"prompt": "Lauren's team of system administrators each deal with hundreds of systems with varying levels of security requirements and find it difficult to handle the multitude of usernames and passwords they each have. What type of solution should she recommend to ensure that passwords are properly handled and that features like logging and password rotation occur? A. A credential management system B. A strong password policy C. Separation of duties D. Single sign-on", "completion": "A. Lauren's team would benefit from a credential management system. Credential management systems offer features like password management, multifactor authentication to retrieve passwords, logging, audit, and password rotation capabilities. A strong password policy would only make maintenance of passwords for many systems a more difficult task if done manually. Single sign-on would help if all of the systems had the same sensitivity levels, but different credentials are normally required for higher-sensitivity systems."}
{"prompt": "Ed's Windows system can't connect to the network and ipconfig shows the following: What has occurred on the system? A. The system has been assigned an invalid IP address by its DHCP server. B. The system has a manually assigned IP address. C.

Windows systems will assign themselves an APIPA address between 169.254.0.1 and 254.255.254 if they cannot contact a DHCP server."}
{"prompt": "What term is commonly used to describe initial creation of a user account in the provisioning process? A. Enrollment B. Clearance verification C. Background checks D. Initialization", "completion": "A. Enrollment, or registration, is the initial creation of a user account in the provisioning process. Clearance verification and background checks are sometimes part of the process that ensures that the identity of the person being enrolled matches who they claim to be. Initialization is not used to describe the provisioning process."}
{"prompt": "What type of forensic investigation typically has the highest evidentiary standards? A. Administrative B. Criminal C. Civil D. Industry", "completion": "B. Criminal forensic investigations typically have the highest standards for evidence, as they must be able to help prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Administrative investigations merely need to meet the standards of the organization and to be able to be defended in court, while civil investigations operate on a preponderance of evidence. There is not a category of forensic investigation referred to as \"industry\" in the CISSP exam's breakdown of forensic types."}
{"prompt": "There is a significant conflict between the drive for profit and the security requirements that Olivia's organization has standardized. Olivia's role means that decreased usability and loss of profit due to her staff's inability to use the system is her major concern. What is the most likely role that Olivia plays in her organization? A. Business manager B. Information security analyst C. Data processor D. Mission owner", "completion": "D. The business or mission owner's role is responsible for making sure systems provide value. When controls decrease the value that an organization gets, the business owner bears responsibility for championing the issue to those involved. There is not a business manager or information security analyst role in the list of NIST-defined data security roles. A data processor is defined but acts as a third-party data handler and would not have to represent this issue in Olivia's organization."}
{"prompt": "Tom believes that a customer of his Internet service provider has been exploiting a vulnerability in his system to read the email messages of other customers. If true, what law did the customer most likely violate? A. ECPA B. CALEA C. HITECH D. Privacy Act", "completion": "A. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) makes it a crime to invade the electronic privacy of an individual. It prohibits the unauthorized monitoring of email and voicemail communications."}
{"prompt": "In the ring protection model shown here, what ring contains user programs and applications? A. Ring 0 B. Ring 1 C. Ring 2 D. Ring 3", "completion": "D.

Checklist review B. Full interruption test C. Parallel test D. Tabletop exercise", "completion": "D. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive."}
{"prompt": "Susan wants to integrate her website to allow users to use accounts from sites like Google. What technology should she adopt? A. Kerberos B. LDAP C. OpenID D. SESAME", "completion": "C. OpenID is a widely supported standard that allows a user to use a single account to log into multiple sites, and Google accounts are frequently used with OpenID."}
{"prompt": "Tom is conducting a business continuity planning effort for Orange Blossoms, a fruit orchard located in Central Florida. During the assessment process, the committee determined that there is a small risk of snow in the region but that the cost of implementing controls to reduce the impact of that risk is not warranted. They elect to not take any specific action in response to the risk. What risk management strategy is Orange Blossoms pursuing? A. Risk mitigation B. Risk transference C. Risk avoidance D. Risk acceptance", "completion": "D. Risk acceptance occurs when an organization determines that the costs involved in pursuing other risk management strategies are not justified and they choose not to pursue any action."}

{"prompt": "Jack's organization is a multinational nonprofit that has small offices in many developing countries throughout the world. They need to implement an access control system that allows flexibility and that can work despite poor Internet connectivity at their locations. What is the best type of access control design for Jack's organization? A. Centralized access control B. Mandatory access control C. Decentralized access control D. Rule-based access control", "completion": "C. Decentralized access control makes sense because it allows local control over access. When network connectivity to a central control point is a problem or if rules and regulations may vary significantly from location to location, centralized control can be less desirable than decentralized control despite its challenges with consistency. Since the problem does not describe specific control needs, mandatory access control and rule-based access controls could fit the need but aren't the best answer."}
{"prompt": "What US government classification label is applied to information that, if disclosed, could cause serious damage to national security and also requires that the damage that would be caused is able to be described or identified by the classification authority? A. Classified B. Secret C. Confidential D. Top Secret", "completion": "B. The US government classifies data that could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security if disclosed, and for which the damage can be identified or described, as Secret. The US government does not use Classified in its formal four levels of classification. Top Secret data could cause exceptionally grave damage, whereas Confidential data could be expected to cause damage."}
{"prompt": "When the certificate authority (CA) created Renee's digital certificate, what key was contained within the body of the certificate? A. Renee's public key B. Renee's private key C. CA's public key D. CA's private key", "completion": "A. The purpose of a digital certificate is to provide the general public with an authenticated copy of the certificate subject's public key."}

Renee's private key C. CA's public key D. CA's private key", "completion": "A. Mike uses the public key that he extracted from Renee's digital certificate to encrypt the message that he would like to send to Renee."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following tools may be used to directly violate the confidentiality of communications on an unencrypted VoIP network? A. Nmap B. Nessus C. Wireshark D. Nikto", "completion": "C. Wireshark is a network monitoring tool that can capture and replay communications sent over a data network, including Voice over IP (VoIP) communications. Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto are all security tools that may identify security flaws in the network, but they do not directly undermine confidentiality because they do not have the ability to capture communications."}
{"prompt": "How does single sign-on increase security? A. It decreases the number of accounts required for a subject. B. It helps decrease the likelihood that users will write down their passwords. C. It provides logging for each system that it is connected to. D. It provides better encryption for authentication data.", "completion": "B. Studies consistently show that users are more likely to write down passwords if they have more accounts. Central control of a single account is also easier to shut off if something does go wrong. Simply decreasing the number of accounts required for a subject doesn't increase security by itself, and SSO does not guarantee individual system logging, although it should provide central logging of SSO activity. Since an SSO system was not specified, there is no way of determining whether a given SSO system provides better or worse encryption for authentication data."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following cryptographic algorithms supports the goal of nonrepudiation? A. Blowfish B. DES C. AES D. RSA", "completion": "D. Nonrepudiation is only possible with an asymmetric encryption algorithm. RSA is an asymmetric algorithm. AES, DES, and Blowfish are all symmetric encryption algorithms that do not provide nonrepudiation."}
{"prompt": "Microsoft's STRIDE threat assessment framework uses six categories for threats: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. If a penetration tester is able to modify audit logs, what STRIDE categories best describe this issue? A. Tampering and information disclosure B. Elevation of privilege and tampering C. Repudiation and denial of service D. Repudiation and tampering", "completion": "D. Modification of audit logs will prevent repudiation because the data cannot be trusted, and thus actions cannot be provably denied. The modification of the logs is also a direct example of tampering. It might initially be tempting to answer elevation of privileges and tampering, as the attacker made changes to files that should be protected, but this is an unknown without more information. Similarly, the attacker may have accessed the files, resulting in information disclosure in addition to tampering, but again, this is not specified in the question. Finally, this did not cause a denial of service, and thus that answer can be ignored."}
{"prompt": "RIP, OSPF, and BGP are all examples of protocols associated with what type of network device? A. Switches B. Bridges C. Routers D. Gateways", "completion": "C. Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) are all routing protocols and are associated with routers."}
{"prompt": "AES-based CCMP and 802.1x replaced what security protocol that was designed as part of WPA to help fix the significant security issues found in WEP? A. TLS B. TKIP C. EAP D. PEAP", "completion": "B. The Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) was used with WPA on existing hardware to replace WEP. TKIP has been replaced by CCMP and 802.1x since 2012. PEAP and EAP are both authentication protocols. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to secure web transactions and other network communications."}
{"prompt": "The government agency that Ben works at installed a new access control system. The system uses information such as Ben's identity, department, normal working hours, job category, and location to make authorization. What type of access control system did Ben's employer adopt? A. Role-based access control B. Attribute-based access control C. Administrative access control D. System discretionary access control", "completion": "B. Each of the attributes linked to Ben's access provides information for an attributebased information control system. Attribute-based information controls like those described in NIST SP 800-162 can take many details about the user, actions, and objects into consideration before allowing access to occur. A role-based access control would simply consider Ben's role, whereas both administrative and system discretionary access controls are not commonly used terms to describe access controls."}
{"prompt": "The Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) attack tool used by Anonymous leverages a multitude of home PCs to attack its chosen targets. This is an example of what type of network attack? A. DDoS B. Ionization C. Zombie horde D. Teardrop", "completion": "A. LOIC is an example of a distributed denial of service attack. It uses many systems to attack targets, combining their bandwidth and making it difficult to shut down the attack because of the number and variety of attackers. Ionization and zombie horde attacks are both made-up answers. Teardrop attacks are an older type of attack that sends fragmented packets as a denial of service attack."}
{"prompt": "Andrew believes that a digital certificate belonging to his organization was compromised and would like to add it to a Certificate Revocation List. Who must add the certificate to the CRL? A. Andrew B. The root authority for the top-level domain C. The CA that issued the certificate D. The revocation authority for the top-level domain", "completion": "C. Certificates may only be added to a Certificate Revocation List by the certificate authority that created the digital certificate."}
{"prompt": "Amanda is considering the implementation of a database recovery mechanism recommended by a consultant. In the recommended approach, an automated process will move records of transactions from the primary site to a backup site on an hourly basis. What type of database recovery technique is the consultant describing? A. Electronic vaulting B. Transaction logging C. Remote mirroring D. Remote journaling", "completion": "D. Remote journaling transfers transaction logs to a remote site on a more frequent basis than electronic vaulting, typically hourly. Transaction logging is not a recovery technique alone; it is a process for generating the logs used in remote journaling. In an electronic vaulting approach, automated technology moves database backups from the primary database server to a remote site on a scheduled basis, typically daily. Remote mirroring maintains a live database server at the backup site and mirrors all transactions at the primary site on the server at the backup site."}
{"prompt": "A process on a system needs access to a file that is currently in use by another process. What state will the process scheduler place this process in until the file becomes available? A. Running B. Ready C. Waiting D. Stopped", "completion": "C. The Waiting state is used when a process is blocked waiting for an external event. The Running state is used when a process is executing on the CPU. The Ready state is used when a process is prepared to execute, but the CPU is not available. The Stopped state is used when a process terminates."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following investigation types has the loosest standards for the collection and preservation of information? A. Civil investigation B. Operational investigation C. Criminal investigation D. Regulatory investigation", "completion": "B. Operational investigations are performed by internal teams to troubleshoot performance or other technical issues.

{"prompt": "Sue was required to sign an NDA when she took a job at her new company. Why did the company require her to sign it? A. To protect the confidentiality of their data B. To ensure that Sue did not delete their data C. To prevent Sue from directly competing with them in the future D. To require Sue to ensure the availability for their data as part of her job", "completion": "A. Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) are designed to protect the confidentiality of an organization's data, including trade secrets during and after the person's employment. NDAs do not protect against deletion or availability issues, and noncompete agreements would be required to stop competition."}
{"prompt": "Susan is concerned about the FAR associated with her biometric technology. What is the best method to deal with the FAR? A. Adjust the CER. B. Change the sensitivity of the system to lower the FRR. C. Add a second factor. D. Replace the biometric system.", "completion": "C. Adding a second factor can ensure that users who might be incorrectly accepted are not given access due to a higher than desired false acceptance rate (FAR) from accessing a system. The CER is the crossover between the false acceptance and false rejection rate (FRR) and is used as a way to measure the accuracy of biometric systems. Changing the sensitivity to lower the FRR may actually increase the FAR, and replacing a biometric system can be expensive in terms of time and cost."}

{"prompt": "Which of the following is not a code review process? A. Email pass-around B. Over the shoulder C. Pair programming D. IDE forcing", "completion": "D. Over-the-shoulder reviews require the original developer to explain her code to a peer while walking through it. Email pass-around code reviews are done by sending code for  review to peers. Pair programming requires two developers, only one of whom writes code while both collaborate. IDE forcing is not a type of code review; an IDE is an integrated development environment."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following attack types depends on precise timing? A. TOCTOU B. SQL injection C. Pass the hash D. Cross-site scripting", "completion": "A. The Time of Check to Time of Use (TOC/TOU) attack exploits timing differences between when a system verifies authorization and software uses that authorization to perform an action. It is an example of a race condition attack. The other three attacks mentioned do not depend on precise timing."}
{"prompt": "What process adds a header and a footer to data received at each layer of the OSI model? A. Attribution B. Encapsulation C. TCP wrapping D. Data hiding", "completion": "B. Encapsulation is a process that adds a header and possibly a footer to data received at each layer before handoff to the next layer. TCP wrappers are a host-based network access control system, attribution is determining who or what performed an action or sent data, and data hiding is a term from object-oriented programming that is not relevant here."}
{"prompt": "Attackers who compromise websites often acquire databases of hashed passwords. What technique can best protect these passwords against automated password cracking attacks that use precomputed values? A. Using the MD5 hashing algorithm B. Using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm C. Salting D. Double-hashing", "completion": "C. Salting adds random text to the password before hashing in an attempt to defeat automated password cracking attacks that use precomputed values. MD5 and SHA-1 are both common hashing algorithms, so using them does not add any security. Doublehashing would only be a minor inconvenience for an attacker and would not be as effective as the use of salting."}

Too much log data will be stored on the system. B. The system is automatically purging archived logs. C. The logs will not contain the information needed. D. The logs will only contain the most recent 20 MB of log data.", "completion": "D. The system is set to overwrite the logs and will replace the oldest log entries with new log entries when the file reaches 20 MB. The system is not purging archived logs because it is not archiving logs. Since there can only be 20 MB of logs, this system will not have stored too much log data, and the question does not provide enough information to know if there will be an issue with not having the information needed."}
{"prompt": "While investigating a widespread distributed denial of service attack, Matt types in the IP address of one of the attacking systems into his bro A. SCADA B. Cloud infrastructure C. Web servers D. IoT", "completion": "D. The image shown is from a network connected web camera.

{"prompt": "Kim learned that the military is planning a classified mission that involves some ASI aircraft. She is concerned that employees not cleared for the mission may learn of it by noticing the movement of many aircraft to the region. Individual employees are cleared to know about the movement of an individual aircraft, but they are not cleared to know about the overall mission. What type of attack is Kim concerned about? A. Aggregation B. SQL injection C. Inference D. Multilevel security", "completion": "A. Aggregation is a security issue that arises when a collection of facts has a higher classification than the classification of any of those facts standing alone. An inference problem occurs when an attacker can pull together pieces of less sensitive information from multiple sources and use them to derive information of greater sensitivity. In this case, only a single source was used. SQL injection is a web application exploit. Multilevel security is a system control that allows the simultaneous processing of information at different classification levels."}
{"prompt": "What technique can Kim employ to prevent employees not cleared for the mission from learning the true location of the aircraft? A. Input validation B. Polyinstantiation C. Parameterization D. Server-side validation", "completion": "B. Polyinstantiation allows the storage of multiple different pieces of information in a database at different classification levels to prevent attackers from conducting aggregation or inference attacks. Kim could store incorrect location information in the database at lower classification levels to prevent the aggregation attack in this scenario. Input validation, server-side validation, and parameterization are all techniques used to prevent web application attacks and are not effective against inference attacks."}
{"prompt": "Kim's database uniquely identifies aircraft by using their tail number. Which one of the following terms would not necessarily accurately describe the tail number? A. Database field B. Foreign key C. Primary key D. Candidate key", "completion": "B. The tail number is a database field because it is stored in the database. It is also a primary key because the question states that the database uniquely identifies aircraft using this field. Any primary key is, by definition, also a candidate key. There is no information provided that the tail number is a foreign key used to reference a different database table."}
{"prompt": "Kim would like to create a key that enforces referential integrity for the database. What type of key does she need to create? A. Primary key B. Foreign key C. Candidate key D. Master key", "completion": "B. Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables in a database. The database enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the foreign key used in a table has a corresponding record with that value as the primary key in the referenced table."}
{"prompt": "Doug is choosing a software development life-cycle model for use in a project he is leading to develop a new business application. He has very clearly defined requirements and would like to choose an approach that places an early emphasis on developing comprehensive documentation. He does not have a need for the production of rapid prototypes or iterative improvement. Which model is most appropriate for this scenario? A. Agile B. Waterfall C. Spiral D. DevOps", "completion": "B. The waterfall model uses an approach that develops software sequentially, spending quite a bit of time up front on the development and documentation of requirements and design. The spiral and Agile models focus on iterative development and are appropriate when requirements are not well understood or iterative development is preferred. DevOps is an approach to integrating development and operations activities and is not an SDLC model."}
{"prompt": "Which individual bears the ultimate responsibility for data protection tasks? A. Data owner B. Data custodian C. User D. Auditor", "completion": "A. The data owner is a senior manager who bears ultimate responsibility for data protection tasks. The data owner typically delegates this responsibility to one or more data custodians."}
{"prompt": "What should be true for salts used in password hashes? A. A single salt should be set so passwords can be de-hashed as needed. B. A single salt should be used so the original salt can be used to check passwords against their hash. C. Unique salts should be stored for each user. D. Unique salts should be created every time a user logs in.", "completion": "C. A unique salt should be created for each user using a secure generation method and stored in that user's record. Since attacks against hashes rely on building tables to compare the hashes against, unique salts for each user make building tables for an entire database essentially impossible鈥攖he work to recover a single user account may be feasible, but large-scale recovery requires complete regeneration of the table each time. A single salt allows rainbow tables to be generated if the salt is stolen or can be guessed based on frequently used passwords. Creating a unique salt each time a user logs in does not allow a match against a known salted hashed password."}
{"prompt": "What type of assessment methods are associated with mechanisms and activities based on the recommendations of NIST SP800-53A, the Guide for Assessing Security Controls in Federal Information Systems? A. Examine and interview B. Test and assess C. Test and interview D. Examine and test", "completion": "D. NIST SP800-53 describes three processes: -Examination, which is reviewing or analyzing assessment objects like specifications, mechanisms, or activities -Interviews, which are conducted with individuals or groups of individuals -Testing, which involves evaluating activities or mechanisms for expected behavior when used or exercised Knowing the details of a given NIST document in depth can be challenging. To address a question like this, first eliminate responses that do not make sense; here, a mechanism cannot be interviewed, and test and assess both mean the same thing. This leaves only one correct answer."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following controls would be most effective in detecting zero-day attack attempts? A. Signature-based intrusion detection B. Anomaly-based intrusion detection C. Strong patch management D. Full-disk encryption", "completion": "B. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems may identify a zero-day vulnerability because it deviates from normal patterns of activity. Signature-based detection methods would not be effective because there are no signatures for zero-day vulnerabilities. Strong patch management would not be helpful because, by definition, zero-day vulnerabilities do not have patches available. Full-disk encryption would not detect an attack because it is not a detective control."}
{"prompt": "The ability to store and generate passwords, provide logging and auditing capabilities, and allow password check-in and check-out are all features of what type of system? A. AAA B. Credential management C. Two-factor authentication D. Kerberos", "completion": "B. Credential management systems provide features designed to make using and storing credentials secure and controllable. AAA systems are authorization, authentication, and accounting systems. Two-factor authentication and Kerberos are examples of protocols."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following components should be included in an organization's emergency response guidelines? A. Secondary response procedures for first responders B. Long-term business continuity protocols C. Activation procedures for the organization's cold sites D. Contact information for ordering equipment", "completion": "A. The emergency response guidelines should include the immediate steps an organization should follow in response to an emergency situation. These include immediate response procedures, a list of individuals who should be notified of the emergency, and secondary response procedures for first responders. They do not include long-term actions such as activating business continuity protocols, ordering equipment, or activating disaster recovery sites."}
{"prompt": "When Jim enters his organization's data center, he has to use a smart card and code to enter and is allowed through one set of doors. The first set of doors closes, and he must then use his card again to get through a second set, which locks behind him. What type of control is this, and what is it called? A. A physical control; a one-way trapdoor B. A logical control; a dual-swipe authorization C. A directive control; a one-way access corridor D. A preventive access control; a mantrap", "completion": "D. A mantrap uses two sets of doors, only one of which can open at a time. A mantrap is a type of preventive access control, although its implementation is a physical control."}
{"prompt": "What security control may be used to implement a concept known as two-person control? A. Mandatory vacation B. Separation of duties C. Least privilege D. Defense in depth", "completion": "B. When following the separation-of-duties principle, organizations divide critical tasks into discrete components and ensure that no one individual has the ability to perform both actions. This prevents a single rogue individual from performing that task in an unauthorized manner and is also known as two-person control."}
