51. C. The Physical layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and standards that
allow control of throughput, handling line noise, and a variety of other electrical
interface and signaling requirements. The OSI layer doesn't have a Device layer. The
Transport layer connects the Network and Session layers, and the Data Link layer
packages packets from the network layer for transmission and receipt by devices
operating on the Physical layer.

52. A. WPA2, the replacement for WPA, does not suffer from the security issues that WEP,
the original wireless security protocol, and WPA, its successor, both suffer from. AES is
used in WPA2 but is not specifically a wireless security standard.

53. A. User awareness is one of the most important tools when dealing with attachments.
Attachments are often used as a vector for malware, and aware users can help prevent
successful attacks by not opening the attachments. Antimalware tools, including
antivirus software, can help detect known threats before users even see the attachments.
Encryption, including tools like S/MIME, won't help prevent attachment-based security
problems, and removing ZIP file attachments will only stop malware that is sent via those
ZIP files.

54. A. The Transport layer provides logical connections between devices, including end-toend transport services to ensure that data is delivered. Transport layer protocols include
TCP, UDP, SSL, and TLS.

55. B. Machine Access Control (MAC) addresses are the hardware address the machine uses
for layer 2 communications. The MAC addresses include an organizationally unique
identifier (OUI), which identifies the manufacturer. MAC addresses can be changed, so
this is not a guarantee of accuracy, but under normal circumstances you can tell what
manufacturer made the device by using the MAC address.

56. D. PEAP provides encryption for EAP methods and can provide authentication. It does
not implement CCMP, which was included in the WPA2 standard. LEAP is dangerously
insecure and should not be used due to attack tools that have been available since the early
2000s.

57. C. Double NATing isn't possible with the same IP range; the same IP addresses cannot
appear inside and outside a NAT router. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved, but only so
they are not used and routable on the Internet, and changing to PAT would not fix the
issue.

58. B. A Class B network holds 2^16 systems, and its default network mask is 255.255.0.0.

59. C. Traditional private branch exchange (PBX) systems are vulnerable to eavesdropping
because voice communications are carried directly over copper wires. Since standard
telephones don't provide encryption (and you're unlikely to add encrypted phones unless
you're the NSA), physically securing access to the lines and central connection points is the
best strategy available.

60. A. Most cordless phones don't use encryption, and even modern phones that use DECT
(which does provide encryption) have already been cracked. This means that a determined
attacker can almost always eavesdrop on cordless phones, and makes them a security risk
if they're used for confidential communication.

61. A. VLAN hopping between the voice and computer VLANs can be accomplished when
devices share the same switch infrastructure. Using physically separate switches can
prevent this attack. Encryption won't help with VLAN hopping because it relies on header
data that the switch needs to read (and this is unencrypted), while Caller ID spoofing is an
inherent problem with VoIP systems. A denial of service is always a possibility, but it isn't
specifically a VoIP issue and a firewall may not stop the problem if it's on a port that must
be allowed through.

62. B. All stateful inspection firewalls enforce an implicit deny rule as the final rule of the
rulebase. It is designed to drop all inbound traffic that was not accepted by an earlier
rule. Stealth rules hide the firewall from external networks, but they are not included by
default. This firewall does not contain any egress filtering rules, and egress filtering is not
enforced by default. Connection proxying is an optional feature of stateful inspection
firewalls and would not be enforced without a rule explicitly implementing it.

63. A. SMTP uses ports 25 and 465. The presence of an inbound rule allowing SMTP traffic
indicates that this is an email server.

64. C. The HTTP connection will be allowed, despite the presence of rule #2, because it
matches rule #1. The HTTPS connection will be blocked because there is no rule allowing
HTTPS connections to this server.

65. D. The firewall should be configured to accept inbound connections from any port selected
by the source system. The vast majority of inbound firewall rules allow access from any
source port.

66. A. Data streams are associated with the Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
Once they reach the Transport layer, they become segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP).
From there, they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link
layer, and bits at the Physical layer.

67. C. A three-tier design separates three distinct protected zones and can be accomplished
with a single firewall that has multiple interfaces. Single- and two-tier designs don't
support the number of protected networks needed in this scenario, while a four-tier design
would provide a tier that isn't needed.

68. C. Software-defined networking provides a network architecture that can be defined
and configured as code or software. This will allow Lauren's team to quickly change the
network based on organizational requirements. The 5-4-3 rule is an old design rule for
networks that relied on repeaters or hubs. A converged network carries multiple types of
traffic like voice, video, and data. A hypervisor-based network may be software defined,
but it could also use traditional network devices running as virtual machines.

69. B. ISDN, cable modems, DSL, and T1 and T3 lines are all examples of broadband
technology that can support multiple simultaneous signals. They are analog, not digital,
and are not broadcast technologies.

70. A. A single-tier firewall deployment is very simple and does not offer useful design options
like a DMZ or separate transaction subnets.

71. D. Network segmentation can reduce issues with performance as well as diminish the
chance of broadcast storms by limiting the number of systems in a segment. This decreases
broadcast traffic visible to each system and can reduce congestion. Segmentation can also
help provide security by separating functional groups who don't need to be able to access
each other's systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and
outbound traffic, not cross-network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent
loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports
on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues.
Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop
them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm!

72. C. ICMP, RIP, and network address translation all occur at layer 3, the Network layer.

73. C. One of the visibility risks of virtualization is that communication between servers and
systems using virtual interfaces can occur "inside" the virtual environment. This means
that visibility into traffic in the virtualization environment has to be purpose-built as part
of its design. Option D is correct but incomplete because inter-hypervisor traffic isn't the
only traffic the IDS will see.

74. B. Cut and paste between virtual machines can bypass normal network-based data loss
prevention tools and monitoring tools like an IDS or IPS. Thus, it can act as a covert
channel, allowing the transport of data between security zones. So far, cut and paste has
not been used as a method for malware spread in virtual environments and has not been
associated with denial of service attacks. Cut and paste requires users to be logged in and
does not bypass authentication requirements.

75. A. While virtual machine escape has only been demonstrated in laboratory environments,
the threat is best dealt with by limiting what access to the underlying hypervisor can
prove to a successful tracker. Segmenting by data types or access levels can limit the
potential impact of a hypervisor compromise. If attackers can access the underlying
system, restricting the breach to only similar data types or systems will limit the impact.
Escape detection tools are not available on the market, restoring machines to their original
snapshots will not prevent the exploit from occurring again, and Tripwire detects file
changes and is unlikely to catch exploits that escape the virtual machines themselves.

76. C. WPA2's CCMP encryption scheme is based on AES. As of the writing of this book,
there have not been any practical real-world attacks against WPA2. DES has been
successfully broken, and neither 3DES nor TLS is used for WPA2.

77. B. Ethernet networks use Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/
CD) technology. When a collision is detected and a jam signal is sent, hosts wait a random
period of time before attempting retransmission.

78. C. A T3 (DS-3) line is capable of 44.736 Mbps. This is often referred to as 45 Mbps. A T1
is 1.544 Mbps, ATM is 155 Mbps, and ISDN is often 64 or 128 Kbps.

79. B. A two-tier firewall uses a firewall with multiple interfaces or multiple firewalls in series.
This image shows a firewall with two protected interfaces, with one used for a DMZ and
one used for a protected network. This allows traffic to be filtered between each of the
zones (Internet, DMZ, and private network).

80. B. Endpoint security solutions face challenges due to the sheer volume of data that they
can create. When each workstation is generating data about events, this can be a massive
amount of data. Endpoint security solutions should reduce the number of compromises
when properly implemented, and they can also help by monitoring traffic after it is
decrypted on the local host. Finally, non-TCP protocols are relatively uncommon on
modern networks, making this a relatively rare concern for endpoint security system
implementations.

81. D. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address and will resolve to the local machine.
Public addresses are non-RFC 1918, non-reserved addresses. RFC 1918 addresses are
reserved and include ranges like 10.x.x.x. An APIPA address is a self-assigned address
used when a DHCP server cannot be found.

82. B. Since Bluetooth doesn't provide strong encryption, it should only be used for activities
that are not confidential. Bluetooth PINs are four-digit codes that often default to 0000.
Turning it off and ensuring that your devices are not in discovery mode can help prevent
Bluetooth attacks.

83. C. The assignment of endpoint systems to VLANs is normally performed by a network switch.

84. B. Fibre Channel over Ethernet allows Fibre Channel communications over Ethernet
networks, allowing existing high-speed networks to be used to carry storage traffic. This
avoids the cost of a custom cable plant for a Fibre Channel implementation. MPLS, or
Multiprotocol Label Switching, is used for high performance networking; VoIP is Voice
over IP; and SDN is software-defined networking.

85. D. A modem (MOdulator/DEModulator) modulates between an analog carrier like
a phone line and digital communications like those used between computers. While
modems aren't in heavy use in most areas, they are still in place for system control and
remote system contact and in areas where phone lines are available but other forms of
communication are too expensive or not available.

87. B. A teardrop attack uses fragmented packets to target a flaw in how the TCP stack on
a system handles fragment reassembly. If the attack is successful, the TCP stack fails,
resulting in a denial of service. Christmas tree attacks set all of the possible TCP flags on
a packet, thus "lighting it up like a Christmas tree." Stack killer and frag grenade attacks
are made-up answers.

88. D. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is used for dial-up connections for modems, IDSN,
Frame Relay, and other technologies. It replaced SLIP in almost all cases. PPTP is the
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol used for VPNs, and SLAP is not a protocol at all!

89. B. While non-IP protocols like IPX/SPX, NetBEUI, and AppleTalk are rare in modern
networks, they can present a challenge because many firewalls are not capable of filtering
them. This can create risks when they are necessary for an application or system's function 
because they may have to be passed without any inspection. Christmas tree attacks set all
of the possible flags on a TCP packet (and are thus related to an IP protocol), IPX is not
an IP-based protocol, and while these protocols are outdated, there are ways to make even
modern PCs understand them.

90. C. Of the three answers, PEAP is the best solution. It encapsulates EAP in a TLS tunnel,
providing strong encryption. LEAP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that was originally
designed to help deal with problems in WEP. LEAP's protections have been defeated,
making it a poor choice.

91. A. L2TP can use IPsec to provide encryption of traffic, ensuring confidentiality of the
traffic carried via an L2TP VPN. PPTP sends the initial packets of a session in plaintext,
potentially including usernames and hashed passwords. PPTP does support EAP and was
designed to encapsulate PPP packets. All VPNs are point to point, and multipoint issues
are not a VPN problem.

92. C. A full mesh topology directly connects each machine to every other machine on the
network. For five systems, this means four connections per system.

93. D. Ethernet uses a bus topology. While devices may be physically connected to a switch in
a physical topology that looks like a star, systems using Ethernet can all transmit on the
bus simultaneously, possibly leading to collisions.

94. D. ARP spoofing is often done to replace a target's cache entry for a destination IP,
allowing the attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. A denial of service attack
would be aimed at disrupting services rather than spoofing an ARP response, a replay
attack will involve existing sessions, and a Trojan is malware that is disguised in a way
that makes it look harmless.

95. B. Category 3 UTP cable is primarily used for phone cables and was also used for early
Ethernet networks where it provided 10 Mbps of throughput. Cat 5 cable provides 100
Mbps (and 1000 Mbps if it is Cat 5e). Cat 6 cable can also provide 1000 Mbps.

96. B. Crosstalk occurs when data transmitted on one set of wires is picked up on another
set of wires. Interference like this is electromagnetic rather than simply magnetic,
transmission absorption is a made-up term, and amplitude modulation is how AM radio
works.

97. B. WEP's implementation of RC4 is weakened by its use of a static common key and a
limited number of initialization vectors. It does not use asymmetric encryption, and clients
do not select encryption algorithms.

98. B. VLANs can be used to logically separate groups of network ports while still providing
access to an uplink. Per-room VPNs would create significant overhead for support as well
as create additional expenses. Port security is used to limit what systems can connect to
ports, but it doesn't provide network security between systems. Finally, while firewalls
might work, they would add additional expense and complexity without adding any
benefits over a VLAN solution.

99. D. MAC addresses and their organizationally unique identifiers are used at the Data
Link layer to identify systems on a network. The Application and Session layers don't
care about physical addresses, while the Physical layer involves electrical connectivity and
handling physical interfaces rather than addressing.

100. C. Domain Keys Identified Mail, or DKIM, is designed to allow assertions of domain identity
to validate email. S/MIME, PEM, and MOSS are all solutions that can provide authentication,
integrity, nonrepudiation, and confidentiality, depending on how they are used.
