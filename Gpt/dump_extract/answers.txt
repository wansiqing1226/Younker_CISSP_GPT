1. C. Detective access controls operate after the fact and are intended to detect or discover
unwanted access or activity. Preventive access controls are designed to prevent the activity
from occurring, whereas corrective controls return an environment to its original status
after an issue occurs. Directive access controls limit or direct the actions of subjects to
ensure compliance with policies.

2. C. A honeypot is a decoy computer system used to bait intruders into attacking.
A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots that creates a more sophisticated
environment for intruders to explore. A pseudoflaw is a false vulnerability in a system
that may attract an attacker. A darknet is a segment of unused network address space that
should have no network activity and, therefore, may be easily used to monitor for illicit
activity.

3. C. The CER is the point where FAR and FRR cross over, and it is a standard assessment
used to compare the accuracy of biometric devices.

4. A. At point B, the false acceptance rate (FAR) is quite high, whereas the false rejection
rate (FRR) is relatively low. This may be acceptable in some circumstances, but in
organizations where a false acceptance can cause a major problem, it is likely that they
should instead choose a point to the right of point A.

5. B. CER is a standard used to assess biometric devices. If the CER for this device does not
fit the needs of the organization, Ben should assess other biometric systems to find one
with a lower CER. Sensitivity is already accounted for in CER charts, and moving the
CER isn't something Ben can do. FRR is not a setting in software, so Ben can't use that as
an option either.

6. B. Personally identifiable information (PII) can be used to distinguish a person's identity.
Personal health information (PHI) includes data like medical history, lab results, insurance
information, and other details about a patient. Personal Protected Data is a made-up
term, and PID is an acronym for process ID, the number associated with a running
program or process.

7. D. The figure shows the waterfall model, developed by Winston Royce. The key
characteristic of this model is a series of sequential steps that include a feedback loop that
allows the process to return one step prior to the current step when necessary.

8. B. Encapsulation creates both the benefits and potential issues with multilayer protocols.
Bridging can use various protocols but does not rely on encapsulation. Hashing
and storage protocols typically do not rely on encapsulation as a core part of their
functionality.

9. B. The five COBIT principles are meeting stakeholder needs, covering the enterprise
end-to-end, applying a single integrated framework, enabling a holistic approach, and
separating governance from management.

10. A. The onward transfer principle requires that organizations only exchange personal
information with other organizations bound by the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) privacy principles. France, Italy, and Germany, as EU member states,
are all bound by those principles. The United States does not have a comprehensive privacy
law codifying those principles, so the onward transfer requirement applies.

11. The protocols match with the descriptions as follows:
1. TCP: C. Transports data over a network in a connection-oriented fashion.
2. UDP: D. Transports data over a network in a connectionless fashion.
3. DNS: B. Performs translations between FQDNs and IP addresses.
4. ARP: A. Performs translations between MAC addresses and IP addresses.
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-friendly fully qualified domain
names (FQDNs) into IP addresses, making it possible to easily remember websites and
hostnames. ARP is used to resolve IP addresses into MAC addresses. TCP and UDP
are used to control the network traffic that travels between systems. TCP does so in a
connection-oriented fashion using the three-way handshake, while UDP uses connectionless "best effort" delivery.

12. B. Ben is assessing a specification. Specifications are document-based artifacts like policies
or designs. Activities are actions that support an information system that involves people.
Mechanisms are the hardware-, software-, or firmware-based controls or systems in an
information system, and an individual is one or more people applying specifications,
mechanisms, or activities.

13. C. When done properly, a sanitization process fully ensures that data is not remnant
on the system before it is reused. Clearing and erasing can both be failure prone, and of
course destruction wouldn't leave a machine or device to reuse.

14. C. In a gray box test, the tester evaluates the software from a user perspective but has
access to the source code as the test is conducted. White box tests also have access to the
source code but perform testing from a developer's perspective. Black box tests work from
a user's perspective but do not have access to source code. Blue boxes are a telephone
hacking tool and not a software testing technique.

15. D. The DevOps approach to technology management seeks to integrate software
development, operations, and quality assurance in a cohesive effort. It specifically attempts
to eliminate the issue of "throwing problems over the fence" by building collaborative
relationships between members of the IT team.

16. B. A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool is designed to centralize
logs from many locations in many formats and to ensure that logs are read and analyzed
despite differences between different systems and devices. The Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) is used for some log messaging but is not a solution that
solves all of these problems. Most non-Windows devices, including network devices
among others, are not designed to use the Windows event log format, although using NTP
for time synchronization is a good idea. Finally, local logging is useful, but setting clocks
individually will result in drift over time and won't solve the issue with many log sources.

17. C. Mike should use overwriting to protect this device. While degaussing is a valid secure
data removal technique, it would not be effective in this case, since degaussing works
only on magnetic media. Physical destruction would prevent the reuse of the device.
Reformatting is not a valid secure data removal technique.

18. A. The single quotation mark in the input field is a telltale sign that this is a SQL injection
attack. The quotation mark is used to escape outside the SQL code's input field and the
text that follows is used to directly manipulate the SQL command sent from the web
application to the database.

19. D. Procedures are formal, mandatory documents that provide detailed, step-by-step
actions required from individuals performing a task.

20. D. Durability requires that once a transaction is committed to the database it must be
preserved. Atomicity ensures that if any part of a database transaction fails, the entire
transaction must be rolled back as if it never occurred. Consistency ensures that all
transactions are consistent with the logical rules of the database, such as having a primary
key. Isolation requires that transactions operate separately from each other.

21. D. Watermarking alters a digital object to embed information about the source,
in either a visible or hidden form. Digital signatures may identify the source of a
document but they are easily removed. Hashing would not provide any indication of
the document source, since anyone could compute a hash value. Document staining is
not a security control.

22. C. Data centers should be located in the core of a building. Locating it on lower floors
makes it susceptible to flooding and physical break-ins. Locating it on the top floor makes
it vulnerable to wind and roof damage.

23. A. The due care principle states that an individual should react in a situation using the
same level of care that would be expected from any reasonable person. It is a very broad
standard. The due diligence principle is a more specific component of due care that
states that an individual assigned a responsibility should exercise due care to complete it
accurately and in a timely manner.

24. B. Criminal investigations have high stakes with severe punishment for the offender that
may include incarceration. Therefore, they use the strictest standard of evidence of all
investigations: beyond a reasonable doubt. Civil investigations use a preponderance-of-theevidence standard. Regulatory investigations may use whatever standard is appropriate
for the venue where the evidence will be heard. This may include the beyond-a-reasonabledoubt standard, but it is not always used in regulatory investigations. Operational
investigations do not use a standard of evidence.

25. D. Differential backups do not alter the archive bit on a file, whereas incremental and full
backups reset the archive bit to 0 after the backup completes. Partial backups are not a
backup type.

26. B. Warm sites contain the hardware necessary to restore operations but do not have a
current copy of data.

27. C. A power spike is a momentary period of high voltage. A surge is a prolonged period of
high voltage. Sags and brownouts are periods of low voltage.

28. A. Subjects are active entities that can access a passive object to retrieve information from
or about an object. Subjects can also make changes to objects when they are properly
authorized. Users are often subjects, but not all subjects are users.

29. A. OSPF is a link state protocol. Link state protocols maintain a topographical map of
all connected networks and preferentially select the shortest path to remote networks
for traffic. A distance vector protocol would map the direction and distance in hops to
a remote network, whereas shortest path first and link mapping are not types of routing
protocols.

30. A. Machine languages are examples of first-generation programming languages.
Second-generation languages include assembly languages. Third-generation languages
include compiled languages. Fourth- and fifth-generation languages go beyond standard
compiled languages to include natural languages and declarative approaches to
programming.

31. A. Tara first must achieve a system baseline. She does this by applying the most recent
full backup to the new system. This is Sunday's full backup. Once Tara establishes this
baseline, she may then proceed to apply differential backups to bring the system back to a
more recent state.

32. B. To restore the system to as current a state as possible, Tara must first apply Sunday's
full backup. She may then apply the most recent differential backup, from Wednesday at
noon. Differential backups include all files that have changed since the most recent full
backup, so the contents of Wednesday's backup contain all of the data that would be
contained in Monday and Tuesday's backups, making the Monday and Tuesday backups
irrelevant for this scenario.

33. A. In this scenario, the differential backup was made at noon and the server failed at
3 p.m. Therefore, any data modified or created between noon and 3 p.m. will not be
contained on any backup and will be irretrievably lost.

34. D. By switching from differential to incremental backups, Tara's weekday backups will
only contain the information changed since the previous day. Therefore, she must apply all
of the available incremental backups. She would begin by restoring the Sunday full backup
and then apply the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday incremental backups.

35. D. Each incremental backup contains only the information changed since the most recent
full or incremental backup. If we assume that the same amount of information changes
every day, each of the incremental backups would be roughly the same size.

36. A. Information that is modifiable between a client and a server also means that it
is accessible, pointing to both tampering and information disclosure. Spoofing in
STRIDE is aimed at credentials and authentication, and there is no mention of this in
the question. Repudiation would require that proving who performed an action was
important, and elevation of privilege would come into play if privilege levels were
involved.

37. B. Record retention ensures that data is kept and maintained as long as it is needed, and
that it is purged when it is no longer necessary. Data remanence occurs when data is left
behind after an attempt is made to remove it, whereas data redaction is not a technical
term used to describe this effort. Finally, audit logging may be part of the records retained
but doesn't describe the lifecycle of data.

38. D. The Authentication Header provides authentication, integrity, and nonrepudiation
for IPsec connections. The Encapsulating Security Payload provides encryption and thus
provides confidentiality. It can also provide limited authentication. L2TP is an independent
VPN protocol, and Encryption Security Header is a made-up term.

39. B. The attack described in the scenario is a classic example of TCP scanning, a network
reconnaissance technique that may precede other attacks. There is no evidence that the
attack disrupted system availability, which would characterize a denial of service attack;
that it was waged by a malicious insider; or that the attack resulted in the compromise of a
system.

40. C. Windows system logs include reboots, shutdowns, and service state changes.
Application logs record events generated by programs, security logs track events like logins
and uses of rights, and setup logs track application setup.

41. D. The kernel lies within the central ring, Ring 0. Ring 1 contains other operating
system components. Ring 2 is used for drivers and protocols. User-level programs and
applications run at Ring 3. Rings 0 to 2 run in privileged mode, whereas Ring 3 runs in
user mode.

42. A. RAID level 0 is also known as disk striping. RAID 1 is called disk mirroring. RAID 5
is called disk striping with parity. RAID 10 is known as a stripe of mirrors.

43. A. This is an example of a time of check/time of use, or TOC/TOU attack. It exploits the
difference between the times when a system checks for permission to perform an action
and when the action is actually performed. Permissions creep would occur if the account
had gained additional rights over time as the other's role or job changed. Impersonation
occurs when an attacker pretends to be a valid user, and link swap is not a type of attack.

44. B. RAID 0, or disk striping, requires at least two disks to implement. It improves
performance of the storage system but does not provide fault tolerance.

45. B. Fred's company needs to protect integrity, which can be accomplished by digitally
signing messages. Any change will cause the signature to be invalid. Encrypting isn't
necessary because the company does not want to protect confidentiality. TLS can provide
in-transit protection but won't protect integrity of the messages, and of course a hash used
without a way to verify that the hash wasn't changed won't ensure integrity either.

46. A. An attribute-based access control (ABAC) system will allow Susan to specify details
about subjects, objects, and access, allowing granular control. Although a rule-based
access control system (RBAC) might allow this, the attribute-based access control system
can be more specific and thus is more flexible. Discretionary access control (DAC) would
allow object owners to make decisions, and mandatory access controls (MACs) would use
classifications; neither of these capabilities was described in the requirements.

47. C. Synchronous communications use a timing or clock mechanism to control the data
stream. This can permit very fast communication.

48. B. The maximum allowed length of a Cat 6 cable is 100 meters, or 328 feet. Long
distances are typically handled by a fiber run or by using network devices like switches or
repeaters.

49. B. One of the main functions of a forensic drive controller is preventing any command
sent to a device from modifying data stored on the device. For this reason, forensic drive
controllers are also often referred to as write blockers.

50. A. Setting the Secure cookie will only allow cookies to be sent via HTTPS TLS or SSL
sessions, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks that target cookies. The rest of the settings
are problematic: Cookies are vulnerable to DNS spoofing. Domain cookies should usually
have the narrowest possible scope, which is actually accomplished by not setting the
Domain cookie. This allows only the originating server to access the cookie. Cookies
without the Expires or Max-age attributes are ephemeral and will only be kept for the
session, making them less vulnerable than stored cookies. Normally, the HTTPOnly
attribute is a good idea, but it prevents scripting rather than requiring unencrypted HTTP
sessions.

51. D. Data remanence describes data that is still on media after an attempt has been made to
remove it. Failed clearing and data pooling are not technical terms, and data permanence
describes how long data lasts.

52. B. Mandatory access control (MAC) applies labels to subjects and objects and allows
subjects to access objects when their labels match. Discretionary access control (DAC) is
controlled by the owner of objects, rule-based access control applies rules throughout a
system, and role-based access control bases rights on roles, which are often handled as
groups of users.

53. B. Identity as a service (IDaaS) provides capabilities such as account provisioning,
management, authentication, authorization, reporting, and monitoring. Platform as a
service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).

54. C. Eavesdropping, denial of service attacks, and Caller ID spoofing are all common VoIP
attacks. Blackboxing is a made-up answer, although various types of colored boxes were
associated with phone phreaking.

55. D. This broad access may indirectly violate all of the listed security principles, but it is
most directly a violation of least privilege because it grants users privileges that they do
not need for their job functions.

56. C. The Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is specifically designed for encrypted file
transfer. SSH is used for secure command-line access, whereas TCP is one of the bundles
of Internet protocols commonly used to transmit data across a network. IPsec could be
used to create a tunnel to transfer the data but is not specifically designed for file transfer.

57. B. TACACS+ uses TCP and encrypts the entire session, unlike RADIUS, which only
encrypts the password and operates via UDP.

58. C. The client sends its existing valid TGT to the KDC and requests access to the resource.

59. A. The KDC must verify that the TGT is valid and whether the user has the right
privileges to access the service it is requesting access to. If it does, it generates a service
ticket and sends it to the client (step B).

60. C. When a client connects to a service server (SS), it sends the following two messages:
-The client-to-server ticket, encrypted using the service's secret key
-A new authenticator, including the client ID and time stamp that is encrypted using the
Client/Server session key.
The server or service that is being accessed receives all of the data it needs in the
service ticket. To do so, the client uses a client-to-server ticket received from the Ticket
Granting Service.

61. B. The service ticket in Kerberos authentication provides proof that a subject is authorized
to access an object. Ticket granting services are provided by the TGS. Proof that a subject
has authenticated and can request tickets to other objects uses ticket-granting tickets, and
authentication host is a made-up term.

62. C. A series of questions that the user has previously provided the answer to or which the
user knows the answers to like the questions listed is known as a cognitive password. A
passphrase consists of a phrase or series of words, whereas multifactor authentication
consists of two or more authenticators, like a password and a biometric factor or a
onetime token-based code.

63. B. CDMA, GSM, and IDEN are all 2G technologies. EDGE, DECT, and UTMS are all
examples of 3G technologies, whereas 4G technologies include WiMax, LTE, and IEE
802.20 mobile broadband.

64. A. Dry pipe, deluge, and preaction systems all use pipes that remain empty until the
system detects signs of a fire. Closed-head systems use pipes filled with water that may
damage equipment if there is damage to a pipe.

65. A. Protected Health Information (PHI) is defined by HIPAA to include health information
used by healthcare providers, like medical treatment, history, and billing. Personally
Identifiable Information is information that can be used to identify an individual, which
may be included in the PHI but isn't specifically this type of data. Protected Health
Insurance and Individual Protected Data are both made-up terms.

66. B. Manual testing uses human understanding of business logic to assess program flow
and responses. Mutation or generational fuzzing will help determine how the program
responds to expected inputs but does not test the business logic. Interface testing ensures
that data exchange between modules works properly but does not focus on the logic of the
program or application.

67. A. A Type 1 authentication factor is something you know. A Type 2 authentication factor
is something you have, like a smartcard or hardware token. A Type 3 authentication
factor is something you are, like a biometric identifier. There is no such thing as a Type 4
authentication factor.

68. B. System owners have to ensure that the systems they are responsible for are properly
labeled based on the highest level of data that their system processes, and they have to
ensure that appropriate security controls are in place on those systems. System owners
also share responsibility for data protection with data owners. Administrators grant
appropriate access, whereas data owners own the classification process.

69. A. Jack is performing misuse case analysis, a process that tests code based on how it
would perform if it was misused instead of used properly. Use case testing tests valid
use cases, whereas static code analysis involves reviewing the code itself for flaws rather
than testing the live software. Hacker use case testing isn't an industry term for a type of
testing.

70. D. Vendors complete security targets (STs) to describe the controls that exist within their
product. During the review process, reviewers compare those STs to the entity's Protection
Profile (PP) to determine whether the product meets the required security controls.

71. C. Both TCP and UDP port numbers are a 16-digit binary number, which means there
can be 216 ports, or 65,536 ports, numbered from 0 to 65,535.

72. A. MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits (CVE) dictionary and NIST's
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) both provide information about vulnerabilities.

73. D. The military classification scheme contains three major levels. They are, in descending
order of sensitivity: Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential. Unclassified is a default, and
not a classification, whereas Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) has been replaced with
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

74. D. In an automated recovery, the system can recover itself against one or more failure
types. In an automated recovery without undue loss, the system can recover itself against
one or more failure types and also preserve data against loss. In function recovery, the
system can restore functional processes automatically. In a manual recovery approach, the
system does not fail into a secure state but requires an administrator to manually restore
operations.

75. A. Antenna placement, antenna design, and power level control are the three important
factors in determining where a signal can be accessed and how usable it is. A captive
portal can be used to control user logins, and antenna design is part of antenna types. The
FCC does provide maximum broadcast power guidelines but does not require a minimum
power level.

76. C. Physically destroying the drive is the best way to ensure that there is no remnant data
on the drive. SSDs are flash media, which means that you can't degauss them, whereas
both random pattern writes and the built-in erase commands have been shown to be
problematic due to the wear leveling built into SSDs as well as differences in how they
handle erase commands.

77. A. Confidentiality ensures that data cannot be read by unauthorized individuals while
stored or in transit.

78. B. The recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time that it may take to restore a
service after a disaster without unacceptable impact on the business. The RTO for each
service is identified during a business impact assessment.

79. D. The United States Code (USC) contains the text of all federal criminal and civil laws
passed by the legislative branch and signed by the president (or where the president's veto
was overruled by Congress).

80. B. A post-admission philosophy allows or denies access based on user activity after
connection. Since this doesn't check the status of a machine before it connects, it can't
prevent the exploit of the system immediately after connection. This doesn't preclude
out-of-band or in-band monitoring, but it does mean that a strictly post-admission policy
won't handle system checks before the systems are admitted to the network.

81. B. The principle of implicit denial states that any action that is not explicitly allowed is
denied. This is an important concept for firewall rules and other access control systems.
Implementing least privilege ensures that subjects have only the rights they need to
accomplish their job. While explicit deny and final rule fall-through may sound like
important access control concepts, neither is.

82. B. Risks are the combination of a threat and a vulnerability. Threats are the external
forces seeking to undermine security, such as the hacker in this case. Vulnerabilities are
the internal weaknesses that might allow a threat to succeed. In this case, web defacement
is the risk. In this scenario, if the hacker attempts a SQL injection attack (threat) against
the unpatched server (vulnerability), the result is website defacement (risk).

83. A. The kernel of an operating system is the collection of components that work together
to implement a secure, reliable operating system. The kernel contains both the Trusted
Computing Base (TCB) and the reference monitor.

84. A. Val can use statistical sampling techniques to choose a set of records for review that
are representative of the entire day's data. Clipping chooses only records that exceed a set
threshold, so it is not a representative sample. Choosing records based on the time they
are recorded may not produce a representative sample because it may capture events that
occur at the same time each day and miss many events that simply don't occur during the
chosen time period.

85. D. Fiber-optic cable is more expensive and can be much harder to install than stranded
copper cable or coaxial cable, but it isn't susceptible to electromagnetic interference
(EMI). That makes it a great solution for Jen's problem, especially if she is deploying EMIhardened systems to go with her EMI-resistant network cables.

86. D. The request control process provides an organized framework within which users can
request modifications, managers can conduct cost/benefit analyses, and developers can
prioritize tasks.

87. B. Change control provides an organized framework within which multiple developers
can create and test solutions prior to rolling them out into a production environment.

88. C. Release control includes acceptance testing to ensure that any alterations to end-user
work tasks are understood and functional.

89. A. Configuration control ensures that changes to software versions are made in
accordance with the change control and configuration management process. Updates can
be made only from authorized distributions in accordance with those policies.

90. B. Ben is reusing his salt. When the same salt is used for each hash, all users with the same
password will have the same hash, and the attack can either attempt to steal the salt or
may attempt to guess the salt by targeting the most frequent hash occurrences based on
commonly used passwords. Short salts are an issue, but the salts used here are 32 bytes
(256 bits) long. There is no salting algorithm used or mentioned here; salt is an added
value for a hash, and plaintext salting is a made-up term.

91. B. Risk transference involves actions that shift risk from one party to another. Purchasing
insurance is an example of risk transference because it moves risk from the insured to the
insurance company.

92. C. The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) eliminates the latency inherent in
the use of certificate revocation lists by providing a means for real-time certificate
verification.

93. D. Static code analysis uses techniques like control flow graphs, lexical analysis, and data
flow analysis to assess code without running it. Dynamic code analysis runs code on a
real or virtual processor and uses actual inputs for testing. Fuzzing provides unexpected
or invalid input to test how programs handle input outside the norm. Manual analysis is
performed by reading code line by line to identify bugs or other issues.

94. B. TCP's use of a handshake process to establish communications makes it a connectionoriented protocol. TCP does not monitor for dropped connections, nor does the fact that it
works via network connections make it connection-oriented.

95. A. The LDAP bind operation authenticates and specifies the LDAP protocol version.
Auth, StartLDAP, and AuthDN operations do not exist in the LDAP protocol.

96. C. The two most important elements of a qualitative risk assessment are determining the
probability and impact of each risk upon the organization. Likelihood is another word for
probability. Cost should be taken into account but is only one element of impact, which
also includes reputational damage, operational disruption, and other ill effects.

97. B. When a message reaches the Data Link layer, it is called a frame. Data streams exist at
the Application, Presentation, and Session layers, whereas segments and datagrams exist at
the Transport layer (for TCP and UDP, respectively).

98. A. If the (ISC)2 peer review board finds that a certified individual has violated the (ISC)2
code of ethics, the board may revoke their certification. The board is not able to terminate
an individual's employment or assess financial penalties.

99. D. SDLC approaches include steps to provide operational training for support staff as
well as end-user training. The SDLC may use one of many development models, including
the waterfall and spiral models. The SDLC does not mandate the use of an iterative or
sequential approach; it allows for either approach.

100. A. The Bell-LaPadula model includes the Simple Security Property, which prevents an
individual from reading information that is classified at a level higher than the individual's
security clearance.

101. C. Captive portals are designed to show a page that can require actions like accepting an
agreement or recording an email address before connecting clients to the Internet. NAC is
designed to verify whether clients meet a security profile, which doesn't match the needs of
most coffee shops. A wireless gateway is a tool to access a cellular or other network, rather
than a way to interact with users before they connect, and 802.11 is the family of IEEE
wireless standards.

102. A. Active monitoring is also known as synthetic monitoring and relies on prerecorded or
generated traffic to test systems for performance and other issues. Passive monitoring uses
span ports, network taps, or similar technologies to capture actual traffic for analysis.
Reactive monitoring is not a commonly used industry term.

103. B. TCP headers can be 20 to 60 bytes long depending on options that are set.

104. A. Cellular networks have the same issues that any public network does. Encryption
requirements should match those that the organization selects for other public networks
like hotels, conference Wi-Fi, and similar scenarios. Encrypting all data is difficult and
adds overhead, so it should not be the default answer unless the company specifically
requires it. WAP is a dated wireless application protocol and is not in broad use; requiring
it would be difficult. WAP does provide TLS, which would help when in use.

105. D. Fred's best option is to use an encrypted, trusted VPN service to tunnel all of his data
usage. Trusted Wi-Fi networks are unlikely to exist at a hacker conference, normal usage
is dangerous due to the proliferation of technology that allows fake towers to be set up,
and discontinuing all usage won't support Fred's business needs.

106. B. Remote wipe tools are a useful solution, but they only work if the phone can access
either a cellular or Wi-Fi network. Remote wipe solutions are designed to wipe data from
the phone regardless of whether it is in use or has a passcode. Providers unlock phones for
use on other cellular networks rather than for wiping or other feature support.

107. C. The goal of business continuity planning exercises is to reduce the amount of time
required to restore operations. This is done by minimizing the recovery time objective (RTO).

108. D. NIST Special Publication 800-53 describes depth and coverage. Depth is the level of
detail, rigor, and formality of artifacts produced during design and development. Coverage
is the breadth and scope of the assessment conducted. If you encounter a question like
this and are not familiar with the details of a standard like NIST 800-53, or may not
remember them, focus on the meanings of each word and the details of the question. We
can easily rule out affirmation, which isn't a measure. Suitability is a possibility, but depth
fits better than suitability or coverage.

109. The disaster recovery test types, listed in order of their potential impact on the business
from the least impactful to the most impactful, are as follows:
A. Checklist review
B. Parallel test
C. Tabletop exercise
D. Full interruption Test

110. C. Interference is electrical noise or other disruptions that corrupt the contents of packets.
Latency is a delay in the delivery of packets from their source to their destination. Jitter is
a variation in the latency for different packets. Packet loss is the disappearance of packets
in transit that requires retransmission.

111. A. Fagan inspections follow a rigorous, highly structured process to perform code review,
using a planning, overview, preparation, inspection, rework, and follow-up cycle. Fuzzing
feeds unexpected input to programs, while over-the-shoulder code review is simply a
review by having another developer meet with them to review code using a walk-through.
Pair programming uses a pair of developers, one of whom writes code while both talk
through the coding and development process.

112. B. While removing the <SCRIPT> tag from user input, it is not sufficient, as a user may
easily evade this filter by encoding the tag with an XSS filter evasion technique. Frank
was correct to perform validation on the server rather than at the client, but he should use
validation that limits user input to allowed values, rather than filtering out one potentially
malicious tag.

113. C. Fortran is a functional programming language. Java, C++, and C# are all objectoriented languages, meaning that they use the object model and approach programming as
describing the interactions between objects.

114. C. HIPAA requires that anyone working with personal health information on behalf of a
HIPAA-covered entity be subject to the terms of a business associates agreement (BAA).

115. A. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that
the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption
test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. During a parallel test, the
team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing but the primary site remains
operational. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test.
During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster
recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop
exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any
changes to information systems.

116. D. Ed's best option is to install an IPv6 to IPv4 gateway that can translate traffic between
the networks. A bridge would be appropriate for different types of networks, whereas a
router would make sense if the networks were similar. A modern switch might be able
to carry both types of traffic but wouldn't be much help translating between the two
protocols.

117. C. The Rijndael block cipher was selected as the winner and is the cryptographic
algorithm underlying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

118. The services match with the network ports as follows:
1. DNS: D. UDP port 53.
2. HTTPS: A. TCP port 443.
3. SSH: E. TCP port 22.
4. RDP: B. TCP port 3389.
5. MSSQL: C. TCP port 1433.

119. B. The EU General Data Protection Regulation does not require that organizations
provide individuals with employee lists.

120. B. Tammy should choose a warm site. This type of facility meets her requirements for
a good balance between cost and recovery time. It is less expensive than a hot site but
facilitates faster recovery than a cold site. A red site is not a type of disaster recovery
facility.

121. B. When data reaches the Transport layer, it is sent as segments (TCP) or datagrams
(UDP). Above the Transport layer, data becomes a data stream, while below the Transport
layer they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer,
and bits at the Physical layer.

122. D. The Advanced Encryption Standard supports encryption with 128-bit keys, 192-bit
keys, and 256-bit keys.

123. D. An application programming interface (API) allows developers to create a direct
method for other users to interact with their systems through an abstraction that does
not require knowledge of the implementation details. Access to object models, source
code, and data dictionaries also indirectly facilitate interaction but do so in a manner that
provides other developers with implementation details.

125. B. The permissions granted on files in Linux designate what authorized users can do
with those files-read, write, or execute. In the image shown, all users can read, write,
and execute index.html, whereas the owner can read, write, and execute example.txt, the
group cannot, and everyone can write and execute it.
