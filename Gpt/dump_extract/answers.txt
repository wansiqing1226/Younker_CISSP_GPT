101. C. Captive portals are designed to show a page that can require actions like accepting an
agreement or recording an email address before connecting clients to the Internet. NAC is
designed to verify whether clients meet a security profile, which doesn't match the needs of
most coffee shops. A wireless gateway is a tool to access a cellular or other network, rather
than a way to interact with users before they connect, and 802.11 is the family of IEEE
wireless standards.

102. A. Active monitoring is also known as synthetic monitoring and relies on prerecorded or
generated traffic to test systems for performance and other issues. Passive monitoring uses
span ports, network taps, or similar technologies to capture actual traffic for analysis.
Reactive monitoring is not a commonly used industry term.

103. B. TCP headers can be 20 to 60 bytes long depending on options that are set.

104. A. Cellular networks have the same issues that any public network does. Encryption
requirements should match those that the organization selects for other public networks
like hotels, conference Wi-Fi, and similar scenarios. Encrypting all data is difficult and
adds overhead, so it should not be the default answer unless the company specifically
requires it. WAP is a dated wireless application protocol and is not in broad use; requiring
it would be difficult. WAP does provide TLS, which would help when in use.

105. D. Fred's best option is to use an encrypted, trusted VPN service to tunnel all of his data
usage. Trusted Wi-Fi networks are unlikely to exist at a hacker conference, normal usage
is dangerous due to the proliferation of technology that allows fake towers to be set up,
and discontinuing all usage won't support Fred's business needs.

106. B. Remote wipe tools are a useful solution, but they only work if the phone can access
either a cellular or Wi-Fi network. Remote wipe solutions are designed to wipe data from
the phone regardless of whether it is in use or has a passcode. Providers unlock phones for
use on other cellular networks rather than for wiping or other feature support.

107. C. The goal of business continuity planning exercises is to reduce the amount of time
required to restore operations. This is done by minimizing the recovery time objective (RTO).

108. D. NIST Special Publication 800-53 describes depth and coverage. Depth is the level of
detail, rigor, and formality of artifacts produced during design and development. Coverage
is the breadth and scope of the assessment conducted. If you encounter a question like
this and are not familiar with the details of a standard like NIST 800-53, or may not
remember them, focus on the meanings of each word and the details of the question. We
can easily rule out affirmation, which isn't a measure. Suitability is a possibility, but depth
fits better than suitability or coverage.

109. The disaster recovery test types, listed in order of their potential impact on the business
from the least impactful to the most impactful, are as follows:
A. Checklist review
B. Parallel test
C. Tabletop exercise
D. Full interruption Test

110. C. Interference is electrical noise or other disruptions that corrupt the contents of packets.
Latency is a delay in the delivery of packets from their source to their destination. Jitter is
a variation in the latency for different packets. Packet loss is the disappearance of packets
in transit that requires retransmission.

111. A. Fagan inspections follow a rigorous, highly structured process to perform code review,
using a planning, overview, preparation, inspection, rework, and follow-up cycle. Fuzzing
feeds unexpected input to programs, while over-the-shoulder code review is simply a
review by having another developer meet with them to review code using a walk-through.
Pair programming uses a pair of developers, one of whom writes code while both talk
through the coding and development process.

112. B. While removing the <SCRIPT> tag from user input, it is not sufficient, as a user may
easily evade this filter by encoding the tag with an XSS filter evasion technique. Frank
was correct to perform validation on the server rather than at the client, but he should use
validation that limits user input to allowed values, rather than filtering out one potentially
malicious tag.

113. C. Fortran is a functional programming language. Java, C++, and C# are all objectoriented languages, meaning that they use the object model and approach programming as
describing the interactions between objects.

114. C. HIPAA requires that anyone working with personal health information on behalf of a
HIPAA-covered entity be subject to the terms of a business associates agreement (BAA).

115. A. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that
the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption
test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. During a parallel test, the
team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing but the primary site remains
operational. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test.
During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster
recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop
exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any
changes to information systems.

116. D. Ed's best option is to install an IPv6 to IPv4 gateway that can translate traffic between
the networks. A bridge would be appropriate for different types of networks, whereas a
router would make sense if the networks were similar. A modern switch might be able
to carry both types of traffic but wouldn't be much help translating between the two
protocols.

117. C. The Rijndael block cipher was selected as the winner and is the cryptographic
algorithm underlying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

118. The services match with the network ports as follows:
1. DNS: D. UDP port 53.
2. HTTPS: A. TCP port 443.
3. SSH: E. TCP port 22.
4. RDP: B. TCP port 3389.
5. MSSQL: C. TCP port 1433.

119. B. The EU General Data Protection Regulation does not require that organizations
provide individuals with employee lists.

120. B. Tammy should choose a warm site. This type of facility meets her requirements for
a good balance between cost and recovery time. It is less expensive than a hot site but
facilitates faster recovery than a cold site. A red site is not a type of disaster recovery
facility.

121. B. When data reaches the Transport layer, it is sent as segments (TCP) or datagrams
(UDP). Above the Transport layer, data becomes a data stream, while below the Transport
layer they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer,
and bits at the Physical layer.

122. D. The Advanced Encryption Standard supports encryption with 128-bit keys, 192-bit
keys, and 256-bit keys.

123. D. An application programming interface (API) allows developers to create a direct
method for other users to interact with their systems through an abstraction that does
not require knowledge of the implementation details. Access to object models, source
code, and data dictionaries also indirectly facilitate interaction but do so in a manner that
provides other developers with implementation details.

125. B. The permissions granted on files in Linux designate what authorized users can do
with those files-read, write, or execute. In the image shown, all users can read, write,
and execute index.html, whereas the owner can read, write, and execute example.txt, the
group cannot, and everyone can write and execute it.
