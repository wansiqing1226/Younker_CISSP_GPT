{"prompt":"Based upon the information in this scenario, what is the exposure factor for the effect of a tornado on Atwood Landing's data center? A. 10% B. 25% C. 50% D. 75% ->","completion":" C. The exposure factor is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. In this case, that is $5 million in damage divided by the $10 million facility value, or 50%.\n"}
{"prompt":"Based upon the information in this scenario, what is the annualized rate of occurrence for a tornado at Atwood Landing's data center? A. 0.0025 B. 0.005 C. 0.01 D. 0.015 ->","completion":" B. The annualized rate of occurrence is the number of times that risk analysts expect a risk to happen in any given year. In this case, the analysts expect tornados once every 200 years, or 0.005 times per year.\n"}
{"prompt":"Based upon the information in this scenario, what is the annualized loss expectancy for a tornado at Atwood Landing's data center? A. $25,000 B. $50,000 C. $250,000 D. $500,000 ->","completion":" A. The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $5,000,000, and the ARO is 0.005. Multiplying these numbers together gives you the ALE of $25,000.\n"}

{"prompt":"Which of the following is not typically part of a termination process? A. An exit interview B. Recovery of property C. Account termination D. Signing an NCA ->","completion":" D. Signing a noncompete or nondisclosure agreement is typically done at hiring. Exit interviews, recovery of organizational property, and account termination are all common elements of a termination process.\n"}
{"prompt":"Laura has been asked to perform an SCA. What type of organization is she most likely in? A. Higher education B. Banking C. Government D. Healthcare ->","completion":" C. A security controls assessment (SCA) most often refers to a formal US government process for assessing security controls and is often paired with a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) process. This means that Laura is probably part of a government organization or contractor.\n"}
{"prompt":"After conducting a qualitative risk assessment of her organization, Sally recommends purchasing cybersecurity breach insurance. What type of risk response behavior is she recommending? A. Accept B. Transfer C. Reduce D. Reject ->","completion":" B. Purchasing insurance is a means of transferring risk. If Sally had worked to decrease the likelihood of the events occurring, she would have been using a reduce or risk mitigation strategy, while simply continuing to function as the organization has would be an example of an acceptance strategy. Rejection, or denial of the risk, is not a valid strategy, even though it occurs!\n"}
{"prompt":"Angela is an information security architect at a bank and has been assigned to ensure that transactions are secure as they traverse the network. She recommends that all transactions use TLS. What threat is she most likely attempting to stop, and what method is she using to protect against it? A. Man-in-the-middle, VPN B. Packet injection, encryption C. Sniffing, encryption D. Sniffing, TEMPEST ->","completion":" C. Encryption is often used to protect traffic like bank transactions from sniffing. While packet injection and man-in-the-middle attacks are possible, they are far less likely to occur, and if a VPN were used, it would be used to provide encryption. TEMPEST is a specification for techniques used to prevent spying using electromagnetic emissions and wouldn鈥檛 be used to stop attacks at any normal bank.\n"}

Which data management role is most likely to select and apply COBIT to balance the need for security controls against business requirements? A. Business owners B. Data processors C. Data owners D. Data stewards ->","completion":" A. Business owners have to balance the need to provide value with regulatory, security, and other requirements. This makes the adoption of a common framework like COBIT attractive. Data owners are more likely to ask that those responsible for control selection identify a standard to use. Data processors are required to perform specific actions under regulations like the EU GDPR. Finally, in many organizations, data stewards are internal roles that oversee how data is used.\n"}
{"prompt":"What term is used to describe a starting point for a minimum security standard? A. Outline B. Baseline C. Policy D. Configuration guide ->","completion":" B. A baseline is used to ensure a minimum security standard. A policy is the foundation that a standard may point to for authority, and a configuration guide may be built from a baseline to help staff who need to implement it to accomplish their task. An outline is helpful, but outline isn鈥檛 the term you鈥檙e looking for here.\n"}
{"prompt":"When media is labeled based on the classification of the data it contains, what rule is typically applied regarding labels? A. The data is labeled based on its integrity requirements. B. The media is labeled based on the highest classification level of the data it contains. C. The media is labeled with all levels of classification of the data it contains. D. The media is labeled with the lowest level of classification of the data it contains. ->","completion":" B. Media is typically labeled with the highest classification level of data it contains. This prevents the data from being handled or accessed at a lower classification level. Data integrity requirements may be part of a classification process but don鈥檛 independently drive labeling in a classification scheme.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following administrative processes assists organizations in assigning appropriate levels of security control to sensitive information? A. Information classification B. Remanence C. Transmitting data D. Clearing ->","completion":" A. The need to protect sensitive data drives information classification. This allows organizations to focus on data that needs to be protected rather than spending effort on less important data. Remanence describes data left on media after an attempt is made to remove the data. Transmitting data isn鈥檛 a driver for an administrative process to protect sensitive data, and clearing is a technical process for removing data from media.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can a data retention policy help to reduce liabilities? A. By ensuring that unneeded data isn't retained B. By ensuring that incriminating data is destroyed C. By ensuring that data is securely wiped so it cannot be restored for legal discovery D. By reducing the cost of data storage required by law ->","completion":" A. A data retention policy can help to ensure that outdated data is purged, removing potential additional costs for discovery. Many organizations have aggressive retention policies to both reduce the cost of storage and limit the amount of data that is kept on hand and discoverable. Data retention policies are not designed to destroy incriminating data, and legal requirements for data retention must still be met.\n"}
{"prompt":"Staff in an information technology (IT) department who are delegated responsibility for day-to-day tasks hold what data role? A. Business owner B. User C. Data processor D. Custodian ->","completion":" D. Custodians are delegated the role of handling day-to-day tasks by managing and overseeing how data is handled, stored, and protected.

Conduct yearly assessments to the PCI DSS standard. D. Comply with a standard such as the US-EU Privacy Shield. ->","completion":" D. Privacy Shield compliance helps US companies meet the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Yearly assessments may be useful, but they aren鈥檛 required. HIPAA is a US law that applies specifically to healthcare and related organizations, and encrypting all data all the time is impossible (at least if you want to use the data!). PCI DSS is a global contractual regulation for the handling of credit card information.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben has been tasked with identifying security controls for systems covered by his organization's information classification system. Why might Ben choose to use a security baseline? A. It applies in all circumstances, allowing consistent security controls. B. They are approved by industry standards bodies, preventing liability. C. They provide a good starting point that can be tailored to organizational needs. D. They ensure that systems are always in a secure state. ->","completion":" C. Security baselines provide a starting point to scope and tailor security controls to your organization’s needs. They aren鈥檛 always appropriate to specific organizational needs, they cannot ensure that systems are always in a secure state, and they do not prevent liability.\n"}
{"prompt":"What term is used to describe overwriting media to allow for its reuse in an environment operating at the same sensitivity level? A. Clearing B. Erasing C. Purging D. Sanitization ->","completion":" A. Clearing describes preparing media for reuse. When media is cleared, unclassified data is written over all addressable locations on the media. Once that’s completed, the media can be reused. Erasing is the deletion of files or media. Purging is a more intensive form of clearing for reuse in lower-security areas, and sanitization is a series of processes that removes data from a system or media while ensuring that the data is unrecoverable by any means.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following classification levels is the United States (U.S.) government's classification label for data that could cause damage but wouldn't cause serious or grave damage? A. Top Secret B. Secret C. Confidential D. Classified ->","completion":" C. The US government uses the label Confidential for data that could cause damage if it was disclosed without authorization. Exposure of Top Secret data is considered to potentially cause grave damage, while Secret data could cause serious damage. Classified is not a level in the US government classification scheme.\n"}
{"prompt":"What issue is common to spare sectors and bad sectors on hard drives as well as overprovisioned space on modern SSDs? A. They can be used to hide data. B. They can only be degaussed. C. They are not addressable, resulting in data remanence. D. They may not be cleared, resulting in data remanence. ->","completion":" D. Spare sectors, bad sectors, and space provided for wear leveling on SSDs (overprovisioned space) may all contain data that was written to the space that will not be cleared when the drive is wiped. Most wiping utilities only deal with currently addressable space on the drive. SSDs cannot be degaussed, and wear leveling space cannot be reliably used to hide data. These spaces are still addressable by the drive, although they may not be seen by the operating system.\n"}
{"prompt":"What term describes data that remains after attempts have been made to remove the data? A. Residual bytes B. Data remanence C. Slack space D. Zero fill ->","completion":" B. Data remanence is a term used to describe data left after attempts to erase or remove data. Slack space describes unused space in a disk cluster, zero fill is a wiping methodology that replaces all data bits with zeroes, and residual bytes is a made-up term.\n"}
{"prompt":"What civilian data classifications best fit this data? A. Unclassified, confidential, top secret B. Public, sensitive, private C. Public, sensitive, proprietary D. Public, confidential, private ->","completion":" C. Information shared with customers is public, internal business could be sensitive or private, and trade secrets are proprietary. Thus, public, sensitive, proprietary matches this most closely. Confidential is a military classification, which removes two of the remaining options, and trade secrets are more damaging to lose than a private classification would allow.\n"}
{"prompt":"What technique could you use to mark your trade secret information in case it was released or stolen and you need to identify it? A. Classification B. Symmetric encryption C. Watermarks D. Metadata ->","completion":" C. A watermark is used to digitally label data and can be used to indicate ownership. Encryption would have prevented the data from being accessed if it was lost, while classification is part of the set of security practices that can help make sure the right controls are in place. Finally, metadata is used to label data and might help a data loss prevention system flag it before it leaves your organization.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of encryption should you use on the file servers for the proprietary data, and how might you secure the data when it is in motion? A. TLS at rest and AES in motion B. AES at rest and TLS in motion C. VPN at rest and TLS in motion D. DES at rest and AES in motion ->","completion":" B. AES is a strong modern symmetric encryption algorithm that is appropriate for encrypting data at rest. TLS is frequently used to secure data when it is in transit. A virtual private network is not necessarily an encrypted connection and would be used for data in motion, while DES is an outdated algorithm and should not be used for data that needs strong security.\n"}
{"prompt":"What does labeling data allow a DLP system to do? A. The DLP system can detect labels and apply appropriate protections. B. The DLP system can adjust labels based on changes in the classification scheme. C. The DLP system can notify the firewall that traffic should be allowed through. D. The DLP system can delete unlabeled data. ->","completion":" A. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems can use labels on data to determine the appropriate controls to apply to the data. DLP systems won鈥檛 modify labels in real time and typically don鈥檛 work directly with firewalls to stop traffic. Deleting unlabeled data would cause big problems for organizations that haven鈥檛 labeled every piece of data!\n"}
{"prompt":"Why is it cost effective to purchase high-quality media to contain sensitive data? A. Expensive media is less likely to fail. B. The value of the data often far exceeds the cost of the media. C. Expensive media is easier to encrypt. D. More expensive media typically improves data integrity. ->","completion":" B. The value of the data contained on media often exceeds the cost of the media, making more expensive media that may have a longer life span or additional capabilities like encryption support a good choice. While expensive media may be less likely to fail, the reason it makes sense is the value of the data, not just that it is less likely to fail. In general, the cost of the media doesn鈥檛 have anything to do with the ease of encryption, and data integrity isn鈥檛 ensured by better media.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris is responsible for workstations throughout his company and knows that some of the company's workstations are used to handle proprietary information. Which option best describes what should happen at the end of their lifecycle for workstations he is responsible for? A. Erasing B. Clearing C. Sanitization D. Destruction ->","completion":" C. Sanitization is a combination of processes that ensure that data from a system cannot be recovered by any means. Erasing and clearing are both prone to mistakes and technical problems that can result in remnant data and don鈥檛 make sense for systems that handled proprietary information. Destruction is the most complete method of ensuring that data cannot be exposed, and some organizations opt to destroy the entire workstation, but that is not a typical solution due to the cost involved.\n"}
{"prompt":"Rearrange the following U.S. government data classification levels in order, from least sensitive to most sensitive. A. Secret B. Confidential C. Unclassified D. Top Secret ->","completion":" The US government’s classification levels from least to most sensitive are:C. Unclassified锛孊. Confidential锛孉. Secret锛孌. Top Secret\n"}
{"prompt":"What scenario describes data at rest? A. Data in an IPSec tunnel B. Data in an e-commerce transaction C. Data stored on a hard drive D. Data stored in RAM ->","completion":" C.

The CIS Windows 10 baseline C. PCI DSS D. The NSA Windows 10 baseline ->","completion":" C. PCI DSS, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, provides the set of requirements for credit card processing systems. The Microsoft, NSA, and CIS baseline are all useful for building a Windows 10 security standard, but the PCI DSS standard is a better answer.\n"}
{"prompt":"The CIS benchmarks are an example of what practice? A. Conducting a risk assessment B. Implementing data labeling C. Proper system ownership D. Using security baselines ->","completion":" D. The CIS benchmarks are an example of a security baseline. A risk assessment would help identify which controls were needed, and proper system ownership is an important part of making sure baselines are implemented and maintained. Data labeling can help ensure that controls are applied to the right systems and data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Adjusting the CIS benchmarks to your organization's mission and your specific IT systems would involve what two processes? A. Scoping and selection B. Scoping and tailoring C. Baselining and tailoring D. Tailoring and selection ->","completion":" B. Scoping involves selecting only the controls that are appropriate for your IT systems, while tailoring matches your organization’s mission and the controls from a selected baseline. Baselining is the process of configuring a system or software to match a baseline or building a baseline itself. Selection isn鈥檛 a technical term used for any of these processes.\n"}
{"prompt":"How should you determine what controls from the baseline a given system or software package should receive? A. Consult the custodians of the data. B. Select based on the data classification of the data it stores or handles. C. Apply the same controls to all systems. D. Consult the business owner of the process the system or data supports. ->","completion":" B. The controls implemented from a security baseline should match the data classification of the data used or stored on the system. Custodians are trusted to ensure the day-to-day security of the data and should do so by ensuring that the baseline is met and maintained. Business owners often have a conflict of interest between functionality and data security, and of course, applying the same controls everywhere is expensive and may not meet business needs or be a responsible use of resources.\n"}
{"prompt":"What problem with FTP and Telnet makes using SFTP and SSH better alternatives? A. FTP and Telnet aren't installed on many systems. B. FTP and Telnet do not encrypt data. C. FTP and Telnet have known bugs and are no longer maintained. D. FTP and Telnet are difficult to use, making SFTP and SSH the preferred solution. ->","completion":" B. FTP and Telnet do not provide encryption for the data they transmit and should not be used if they can be avoided. SFTP and SSH provide encryption to protect both the data they send and the credentials that are used to log in via both utilities.\n"}
{"prompt":"The government defense contractor that Saria works for has recently shut down a major research project and is planning on reusing the hundreds of thousands of dollars of systems and data storage tapes used for the project for other purposes. When Saria reviews the company's internal processes, she finds that she can't reuse the tapes and that the manual says they should be destroyed. Why isn't Saria allowed to degauss and then reuse the tapes to save her employer money? A. Data permanence may be an issue. B. Data remanence is a concern. C. The tapes may suffer from bitrot. D. Data from tapes can't be erased by degaussing. ->","completion":" B. Many organizations require the destruction of media that contains data at higher levels of classification. Often the cost of the media is lower than the potential costs of data exposure, and it is difficult to guarantee that reused media doesn鈥檛 contain remnant data. Tapes can be erased by degaussing, but degaussing is not always fully effective. Bitrot describes the slow loss of data on aging media, while data permanence is a term sometimes used to describe the life span of data and media.\n"}
{"prompt":"Information maintained about an individual that can be used to distinguish or trace their identity is known as what type of information? A. Personally identifiable information (PII) B. Personal health information (PHI) C. Social Security number (SSN) D. Secure identity information (SII) ->","completion":" A. NIST Special Publication 800-122 defines PII as any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, Social Security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, biometric records, and other information that is linked or linkable to an individual such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. PHI is health-related information about a specific person, Social Security numbers are issued to individuals in the United States, and SII is a made-up term.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the primary information security risk to data at rest? A. Improper classification B. Data breach C. Decryption D. Loss of data integrity ->","completion":" B. The biggest threat to data at rest is typically a data breach. Data at rest with a high level of sensitivity is often encrypted to help prevent this. Decryption is not as significant of a threat if strong encryption is used and encryption keys are well secured. Data integrity issues could occur, but proper backups can help prevent this, and of course data could be improperly classified, but this is not the primary threat to the data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Full disk encryption like Microsoft's BitLocker is used to protect data in what state? A. Data in transit B. Data at rest C. Unlabeled data D. Labeled data ->","completion":" B. Full disk encryption only protects data at rest. Since it encrypts the full disk, it does not distinguish between labeled and unlabeled data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Sue's employer has asked her to use an IPsec VPN to connect to its network. When Sue connects, what does the IPsec VPN allow her to do? A. Send decrypted data over a public network and act like she is on her employer's internal network. B. Create a private encrypted network carried via a public network and act like she is on her employer's internal network. C. Create a virtual private network using TLS while on her employer's internal network. D. Create a tunneled network that connects her employer's network to her internal home network ->","completion":" B. One way to use an IPsec VPN is to create a private, encrypted network (or tunnel) via a public network, allowing users to be a virtual part of their employer’s internal network. IPsec is distinct from TLS and provides encryption for confidentiality and integrity, and of course, in this scenario Sue is connecting to her employer’s network rather than the employer connecting to hers.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the primary purpose of data classification? A. It quantifies the cost of a data breach. B. It prioritizes IT expenditures. C. It allows compliance with breach notification laws. D. It identifies the value of the data to the organization. ->","completion":" D. Classification identifies the value of data to an organization. This can often help drive IT expenditure prioritization and could help with rough cost estimates if a breach occurred, but that’s not the primary purpose. Finally, most breach laws call out specific data types for notification rather than requiring organizations to classify data themselves.\n"}
{"prompt":"Fred's organization allows downgrading of systems for reuse after projects have been finished and the systems have been purged. What concern should Fred raise about the reuse of the systems from his Top Secret classified project for a future project classified as Secret? A. The Top Secret data may be commingled with the Secret data, resulting in a need to relabel the system. B. The cost of the sanitization process may exceed the cost of new equipment. C. The data may be exposed as part of the sanitization process. D. The organization's DLP system may flag the new system due to the difference in data labels. ->","completion":" B. Downgrading systems and media is rare due to the difficulty of ensuring that sanitization is complete. The need to completely wipe (or destroy) the media that systems use means that the cost of reuse is often significant and may exceed the cost of purchasing a new system or media. The goal of purging is to ensure that no data remains, so commingling data should not be a concern, nor should the exposure of the data; only staff with the proper clearance should handle the systems! Finally, a DLP system should flag data based on labels, not on the system it comes from.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following concerns should not be part of the decision when classifying data? A. The cost to classify the data B. The sensitivity of the data C. The amount of harm that exposure of the data could cause D. The value of the data to the organization ->","completion":" A. Classification should be conducted based on the value of the data to the organization, its sensitivity, and the amount of harm that could result from exposure of the data. Cost should be considered when implementing controls and is weighed against the damage that exposure would create.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is the least effective method of removing data from media? A. Degaussing B. Purging C. Erasing D. Clearing ->","completion":" C. Erasing, which describes a typical deletion process in many operating systems, typically removes only the link to the file and leaves the data that makes up the file itself. The data will remain in place but not indexed until the space is needed and it is overwritten. Degaussing works only on magnetic media, but it can be quite effective on it. Purging and clearing both describe more elaborate removal processes.\n"}
{"prompt":"What encryption technology would be appropriate for HIPAA documents in transit? A. BitLocker B. DES C. TLS D. SSL ->","completion":" C. TLS is a modern encryption method used to encrypt and protect data in transit. BitLocker is a full disk encryption technology used for data at rest. DES and SSL are both outdated encryption methods and should not be used for data that requires high levels of security.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren's employer asks Lauren to classify patient X-ray data that has an internal patient identifier associated with it but does not have any way to directly identify a patient. The company's data owner believes that exposure of the data could cause damage (but not exceptional damage) to the organization. How should Lauren classify the data? A. Public B. Sensitive C. Private D. Confidential ->","completion":" C. We know that the data classification will not be the top level classification of \"Confidential\" because the loss of the data would not cause severe damage. This means we have to choose between private (PHI) and sensitive (confidential). Calling this private due to the patient,s personal health information fits the classification scheme, giving us the correct answer.\n"}
{"prompt":"What technology could Lauren's employer implement to help prevent confidential data from being emailed out of the organization? A. DLP B. IDS C. A firewall D. UDP ->","completion":" A. A data loss prevention (DLP) system or software is designed to identify labeled data or data that fits specific patterns and descriptions to help prevent it from leaving the organization. An IDS is designed to identify intrusions. Although some IDS systems can detect specific types of sensitive data using pattern matching, they have no ability to stop traffic. A firewall uses rules to control traffic routing, while UDP is a network protocol.\n"}
{"prompt":"A U.S. government database contains Secret, Confidential, and Top Secret data. How should it be classified? A. Top Secret B. Confidential C. Secret D. Mixed classification ->","completion":" A. When data is stored in a mixed classification environment, it is typically classified based on the highest classification of data included. In this case, the US government,s highest classification is Top Secret. Mixed classification is not a valid classification in this scheme.\n"}
{"prompt":"What tool is used to prevent employees who leave from sharing proprietary information with their new employers? A. Encryption B. NDA C. Classification D. Purging ->","completion":" B. A nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, is a legal agreement that prevents employees from sharing proprietary data with their new employers. Purging is used on media, while classification is used on data. Encryption can help secure data, but it doesn,t stop employees who can decrypt or copy the data from sharing it.\n"}
{"prompt":"What encryption algorithm is used by both BitLocker and Microsoft's Encrypting File System? A. Blowfish B. Serpent C. AES D. 3DES ->","completion":" C. By default, BitLocker and Microsoft,s Encrypting File System (EFS) both use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is the NIST-approved replacement for DES (Data Encryption Standard). Serpent was a competitor of AES, and 3DES was created as a possible replacement for DES.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris is responsible for his organization's security standards and has guided the selection and implementation of a security baseline for Windows PCs in his organization. How can Chris most effectively make sure that the workstations he is responsible for are being checked for compliance and that settings are being applied as necessary? A. Assign users to spot-check baseline compliance. B. Use Microsoft Group Policy. C. Create startup scripts to apply policy at system start. D. Periodically review the baselines with the data owner and system owners. ->","completion":" B. Group Policy provides the ability to monitor and apply settings in a security baseline. Manual checks by users and using startup scripts provide fewer reviews and may be prone to failure, while periodic review of the baseline won,t result in compliance being checked.\n"}
{"prompt":"What term is used to describe a set of common security configurations, often provided by a third party? A. Security policy B. Baseline C. DSS D. NIST SP 800-53 ->","completion":" B. A baseline is a set of security configurations that can be adopted and modified to fit an organization,s security needs. A security policy is written to describe an organization,s approach to security, while DSS is the second half of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. The NIST SP-800 series of documents address computer security in a variety of areas.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of policy describes how long data is retained and maintained before destruction? A. Classification B. Audit C. Record retention D. Availability ->","completion":" C. Record retention policies describe how long an organization should retain data and may also specify how and when destruction should occur. Classification policies describe how and why classification should occur and who is responsible, while availability and audit policies may be created for specific purposes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which attack helped drive vendors to move away from SSL toward TLS-only by default? A. POODLE B. Stuxnet C. BEAST D. CRIME ->","completion":" A. The POODLE (or Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack helped force the move from SSL 3.0 to TLS because it allowed attackers to easily access SSL encrypted messages. Stuxnet was a worm aimed at the Iranian nuclear program, while CRIME and BEAST were earlier attacks against SSL.\n"}
{"prompt":"What security measure can provide an additional security control in the event that backup tapes are stolen or lost? A. Keep multiple copies of the tapes. B. Replace tape media with hard drives. C. Use appropriate security labels. D. Use AES-256 encryption. ->","completion":" D. Using strong encryption, like AES-256, can help ensure that loss of removable media like tapes doesn,t result in a data breach. Security labels may help with handling processes, but they won,t help once the media is stolen or lost. Having multiple copies will ensure that you can still access the data but won,t increase the security of the media. Finally, using hard drives instead of tape only changes the media type and not the risk from theft or loss.\n"}
{"prompt":"Joe works at a major pharmaceutical research and development company and has been tasked with writing his organization's data retention policy. As part of its legal requirements, the organization must comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Code of Federal Regulations Title 21. To do so, it is required to retain records with electronic signatures. Why would a signature be part of a retention requirement? A. It ensures that someone has reviewed the data. B. It provides confidentiality. C. It ensures that the data has not been changed. D. It validates who approved the data. ->","completion":" D. Electronic signatures, as used in this rule, prove that the signature was provided by the intended signer. Electronic signatures as part of the FDA code are intended to ensure that electronic records are \"trustworthy, reliable, and generally equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures executed on paper.\" Signatures cannot provide confidentiality or integrity and don,t ensure that someone has reviewed the data.\n"}
{"prompt":"What protocol is preferred over Telnet for remote server administration via the command line? A. SCP B. SFTP C. WDS D. SSH ->","completion":" D. Secure Shell (SSH) is an encrypted protocol for remote login and command-line access. SCP and SFTP are both secure file transfer protocols, while WDS is the acronym for Windows Deployment Services, which provides remote installation capabilities for Windows operating systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"What method uses a strong magnetic field to erase media? A. Magwipe B. Degaussing C. Sanitization D. Purging ->","completion":" B. Degaussing uses strong magnetic fields to erase magnetic media. Magwipe is a made-up term. Sanitization is a combination of processes used to remove data from a system or media to ensure that it cannot be recovered. Purging is a form of clearing used on media that will be reused in a lower classification or lower-security environment.\n"}
{"prompt":"Steve is concerned about the fact that employees leaving his organization were often privy to proprietary information. Which one of the following controls is most effective against this threat? A. Sanitization B. NDAs C. Clearing D. Encryption ->","completion":" B. Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) are used to enforce confidentiality agreements with employees and may remain in effect even after an employee leaves the organization. Other controls, such as sanitization, clearing, and encryption, would not be effective against information in an employee,s memory.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex works for a government agency that is required to meet U.S. federal government requirements for data security. To meet these requirements, Alex has been tasked with making sure data is identifiable by its classification level. What should Alex do to the data? A. Classify the data. B. Encrypt the data. C. Label the data. D. Apply DRM to the data. ->","completion":" C. Data labels are crucial to identify the classification level of information contained on the media. Digital rights management (DRM) tools provide ways to control how data is used, while encrypting it can help maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Classifying the data is necessary to label it, but it doesn,t automatically place a label on the data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben is following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-88 guidelines for sanitization and disposition as shown here. He is handling information that his organization classified as sensitive, which is a moderate security categorization in the NIST model. If the media is going to be sold as surplus, what process does Ben need to follow? A. Destroy, validate, document B. Clear, purge, document C. Purge, document, validate D. Purge, validate, document ->","completion":" D. The NIST SP 800-88 process for sanitization and disposition shows that media that will be reused and was classified at a moderate level should be purged and then that purge should be validated. Finally, it should be documented.\n"}
{"prompt":"What methods are often used to protect data in transit? A. Telnet, ISDN, UDP B. BitLocker, FileVault C. AES, Serpent, IDEA D. TLS, VPN, IPSec ->","completion":" D. Data in transit is data that is traversing a network or is otherwise in motion. TLS, VPNs, and IPsec tunnels are all techniques used to protect data in transit. AES, Serpent, and IDEA are all symmetric algorithms, while Telnet, ISDN, and UDP are all protocols. BitLocker and FileVault are both used to encrypt data, but they protect only stored data, not data in transit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following data roles bears ultimate organizational responsibility for data? A. System owners B. Business owners C. Data owners D. Mission owners ->","completion":" C. The data owner has ultimate responsibility for data belonging to an organization and is typically the CEO, president, or another senior employee. Business and mission owners typically own processes or programs. System owners own a system that processes sensitive data.\n"}
{"prompt":"What U.S. government agency oversees compliance with the Privacy Shield framework for organizations wishing to use the personal data of EU citizens? A. The FAA B. The FDA C. The DoD D. The Department of Commerce ->","completion":" D. The US Department of Commerce oversees Privacy Shield. Only US organizations subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or US air carriers and ticket agents subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DOT) are permitted to participate in Safe Harbor.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Chris is one of the data owners for the organization, what steps in this process is he most likely responsible for? A. He is responsible for steps 3, 4, and 5. B. He is responsible for steps 1, 2, and 3. C. He is responsible for steps 5, 6, and 7. D. All of the steps are his direct responsibility. ->","completion":" A. Chris is most likely to be responsible for classifying the data that he owns as well as assisting with or advising the system owners on security requirements and control selection. In an organization with multiple data owners, Chris is unlikely to set criteria for classifying data on his own. As a data owner, Chris will also not typically have direct responsibility for scoping, tailoring, applying, or enforcing those controls.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris manages a team of system administrators. What data role are they fulfilling if they conduct steps 6, 7, and 8 of the classification process? A. They are system owners and administrators. B. They are administrators and custodians. C. They are data owners and administrators. D. They are custodians and users. ->","completion":" B. The system administrators are acting in the roles of data administrators who grant access and will also act as custodians who are tasked with the day-to-day application of security controls. They are not acting as data owners who own the data itself. Typically, system administrators are delegated authority by system owners, such as a department head, and of course they are tasked with providing access to users.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Chris's company operates in the European Union and has been contracted to handle the data for a third party, what role is his company operating in when it uses this process to classify and handle data? A. Business owners B. Mission owners C. Data processors D. Data administrators ->","completion":" C. Third-party organizations that process personal data on behalf of a data controller are known as data processors. The organization that they are contracting with would act in the role of the business or mission owners, and others within Chris,s organization would have the role of data administrators, granting access as needed to the data based on their operational procedures and data classification.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not one of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles? A. Information must be processed fairly. B. Information must be deleted within one year of acquisition. C. Information must be maintained securely. D. Information must be accurate. ->","completion":" B.

{"prompt":"Ben's company, which is based in the European Union, hires a third-party organization that processes data for it. Who has responsibility to protect the privacy of the data and ensure that it isn't used for anything other than its intended purpose? A. Ben's company is responsible. B. The third-party data processor is responsible. C. The data controller is responsible. D. Both organizations bear equal responsibility. ->","completion":" D. Under EU regulations, both the organization sharing data and the third-party data processor bear responsibility for maintaining the privacy and security of personal information.\n"}
{"prompt":"Major Hunter, a member of the armed forces, has been entrusted with information that, if exposed, could cause serious damage to national security. Under U.S. government classification standards, how should this data be classified? A. Unclassified B. Top Secret C. Confidential D. Secret ->","completion":" D. The U.S. government specifies Secret as the classification level for information that, if disclosed, could cause serious harm to national security. Top Secret is reserved for information that could cause exceptionally grave harm, while confidential data could be expected to cause less harm. Unclassified is not an actual classification but only indicates that the data may be released to unclassified individuals. Organizations may still restrict access to unclassified information.\n"}
{"prompt":"When a computer is removed from service and disposed of, the process that ensures that all storage media has been removed or destroyed is known as what? A. Sanitization B. Purging C. Destruction D. Declassification ->","completion":" A. Sanitization is the combination of processes used to remove data from a system or media. When a PC is disposed of, sanitization includes the removal or destruction of drives, media, and any other storage devices it may have. Purging, destruction, and declassification are all other handling methods.\n"}
{"prompt":"Linux systems that use bcrypt are using a tool based on what DES alternative encryption scheme? A. 3DES B. AES C. Diffie鈥揌ellman D. Blowfish ->","completion":" D. Bcrypt is based on Blowfish (the b is a key hint here). AES and 3DES are both replacements for DES, while Diffie-Hellman is a protocol for key exchange.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan works in an organization that labels all removable media with the classification level of the data it contains, including public data. Why would Susan's employer label all media instead of labeling only the media that contains data that could cause harm if it was exposed? A. It is cheaper to order all prelabeled media. B. It prevents sensitive media from not being marked by mistake. C. It prevents reuse of public media for sensitive data. D. Labeling all media is required by HIPAA. ->","completion":" B. Requiring all media to have a label means that when unlabeled media is found, it should immediately be considered suspicious. This helps to prevent mistakes that might leave sensitive data unlabeled. Prelabeled media is not necessarily cheaper (nor may it make sense to buy!), while reusing public media simply means that it must be classified based on the data it now contains. HIPAA does not have specific media labeling requirements.\n"}
{"prompt":"Data stored in RAM is best characterized as what type of data? A. Data at rest B. Data in use C. Data in transit D. Data at large ->","completion":" B. Data in use is data that is in a temporary storage location while an application or process is using it. Thus, data in memory is best described as data in use or ephemeral data. Data at rest is in storage, while data in transit is traveling over a network or other channel. Data at large is a made-up term.\n"}
{"prompt":"What issue is the validation portion of the NIST SP 800-88 sample certificate of sanitization (shown here) intended to help prevent? A. Destruction B. Reuse C. Data remanence D. Attribution ->","completion":" C. Validation processes are conducted to ensure that the sanitization process was completed, avoiding data remanence. A form like this one helps to ensure that each device has been checked and that it was properly wiped, purged, or sanitized. This can allow reuse, does not prevent destruction, and does not help with attribution, which is a concept used with encryption to prove who created or sent a file.\n"}
{"prompt":"Why is declassification rarely chosen as an option for media reuse? A. Purging is sufficient for sensitive data. B. Sanitization is the preferred method of data removal. C. It is more expensive than new media and may still fail. D. Clearing is required first. ->","completion":" C. Ensuring that data cannot be recovered is difficult, and the time and effort required to securely and completely wipe media as part of declassification can exceed the cost of new media. Sanitization, purging, and clearing may be part of declassification, but they are not reasons that it is not frequently chosen as an option for organizations with data security concerns.\n"}
{"prompt":"Incineration, crushing, shredding, and disintegration all describe what stage in the lifecycle of media? A. Sanitization B. Degaussing C. Purging D. Destruction ->","completion":" D. Destruction is the final stage in the lifecycle of media and can be done via disintegration, incineration, or a variety of other methods that result in the media and data being nonrecoverable. Sanitization is a combination of processes used when data is being removed from a system or media. Purging is an intense form of clearing, and degaussing uses strong magnetic fields to wipe data from magnetic media.\n"}
{"prompt":"The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not include which of the following key elements? A. The need to collect information for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes B. The need to ensure that collection is limited to the information necessary to achieve the stated purpose C. The need to protect data against accidental destruction D. The need to encrypt information at rest ->","completion":" D. The GDPR does include the need to collect information for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; the need to ensure that collection is limited to the information necessary to achieve the stated purpose; and the need to protect data against accidental destruction. It does not include a specific requirement to encrypt information at rest.\n"}
{"prompt":"Why might an organization use unique screen backgrounds or designs on workstations that deal with data of different classification levels? A. To indicate the software version in use B. To promote a corporate message C. To promote availability D. To indicate the classification level of the data or system ->","completion":" D. Visual indicators like a distinctive screen background can help employees remember what level of classification they are dealing with and thus the handling requirements that they are expected to follow.\n"}
{"prompt":"Charles has been asked to downgrade the media used for storage of private data for his organization. What process should Charles follow? A. Degauss the drives, and then relabel them with a lower classification level. B. Pulverize the drives, and then reclassify them based on the data they contain. C. Follow the organization's purging process, and then downgrade and replace labels. D. Relabel the media, and then follow the organization's purging process to ensure that the media matches the label. ->","completion":" C. If an organization allows media to be downgraded, the purging process should be followed, and then the media should be relabeled. Degaussing may be used for magnetic media but won,t handle all types of media. Pulverizing would destroy the media, preventing reuse, while relabeling first could lead to mistakes that result in media that hasn,t been purged entering use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following tasks are not performed by a system owner per NIST SP 800-18? A. Develops a system security plan B. Establishes rules for appropriate use and protection of data C. Identifies and implements security controls D. Ensures that system users receive appropriate security training ->","completion":" B. The data owner sets the rules for use and protection of data. The remaining options all describe tasks for the system owner, including implementation of security controls.\n"}
{"prompt":"NIST SP 800-60 provides a process shown in the following diagram to assess information systems. What process does this diagram show? A. Selecting a standard and implementing it B. Categorizing and selecting controls C. Baselining and selecting controls D. Categorizing and sanitizing ->","completion":" B. In the NIST SP 800-60 diagram, the process determines appropriate categorization levels resulting in security categorization and then uses that as an input to determine controls. Standard selection would occur at an organizational level, while baselining occurs when systems are configured to meet a baseline. Sanitization would require the intentional removal of data from machines or media.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which letters on this diagram are locations where you might find data at rest? A. A, B, and C B. C and E C. A and E D. B, D, and F ->","completion":" C. A and E can both be expected to have data at rest. C, the Internet, is an unknown, and the data can,t be guaranteed to be at rest. B, D, and F are all data in transit across network links.\n"}
{"prompt":"What would be the best way to secure data at points B, D, and F? A. AES-256 B. SSL C. TLS D. 3DES ->","completion":" C. B, D, and F all show network links. Of the answers provided, Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides the best security for data in motion. AES-256 and 3DES are both symmetric ciphers and are more likely to be used for data at rest. SSL has been replaced with TLS and should not be a preferred solution.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the best way to secure files that are sent from workstation A via the internet service (C) to remote server E? A. Use AES at rest at point A, and use TLS in transit via B and D. B. Encrypt the data files and send them. C. Use 3DES and TLS to provide double security. D. Use full disk encryption at A and E, and use SSL at B and D. ->","completion":" B. Sending a file that is encrypted before it leaves means that exposure of the file in transit will not result in a confidentiality breach and the file will remain secure until decrypted at location E. Since answers A, C, and D do not provide any information about what happens at point C, they should be considered insecure, as the file may be at rest at point C in an unencrypted form.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan needs to provide a set of minimum security requirements for email. What steps should she recommend for her organization to ensure that the email remains secure? A. All email should be encrypted. B. All email should be encrypted and labeled. C. Sensitive email should be encrypted and labeled. D. Only highly sensitive email should be encrypted. ->","completion":" C. Encrypting and labeling sensitive email will ensure that it remains confidential and can be identified. Performing these actions only on sensitive email will reduce the cost and effort of encrypting all email, allowing only sensitive email to be the focus of the organization,s efforts. Only encrypting highly sensitive email not only skips labeling but might expose other classifications of email that shouldn,t be exposed.\n"}
{"prompt":"What term describes the process of reviewing baseline security controls and selecting only the controls that are appropriate for the IT system you are trying to protect? A. Standard creation B. CIS benchmarking C. Baselining D. Scoping ->","completion":" D. Scoping is performed when you match baseline controls to the IT system you,re working to secure. Creation of standards is part of the configuration process and may involve the use of baselines. Baselining can mean the process of creating a security baseline or configuring systems to meet the baseline. CIS, the Center for Internet Security, provides a variety of security baselines.\n"}
{"prompt":"What data role does a system that is used to process data have? A. Mission owner B. Data owner C. Data processor D. Custodian ->","completion":" C. Systems used to process data are data processors. Data owners are typically CEOs or other very senior staff, custodians are granted rights to perform day-to-day tasks when handling data, and mission owners are typically program or information system owners.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is not considered PII under U.S. federal government regulations? A. Name B. Social security number C. Student ID number D. ZIP code ->","completion":" D. Personally identifiable information includes any information that can uniquely identify an individual. This would include name, Social Security number, and any other unique identifier (including a student ID number). ZIP code, by itself, does not uniquely identify an individual.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of health information is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act required to protect? A. PII B. PHI C. SHI D. HPHI ->","completion":" B. Protected health information, or PHI, includes a variety of data in multiple formats, including oral and recorded data, such as that created or received by healthcare providers, employers, and life insurance providers. PHI must be protected by HIPAA. PII is personally identifiable information. SHI and HPHI are both made-up acronyms.\n"}
{"prompt":"What encryption algorithm would provide strong protection for data stored on a USB thumb drive? A. TLS B. SHA1 C. AES D. DES ->","completion":" C. AES is a strong symmetric cipher that is appropriate for use with data at rest. SHA1 is a cryptographic hash, while TLS is appropriate for data in motion. DES is an outdated and insecure symmetric encryption method.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren's multinational company wants to ensure compliance with the EU GDPR. Which principle of the GDPR states that the individual should have the right to receive personal information concerning himself or herself and share it with another data controller? A. Onward transfer B. Data integrity C. Enforcement D. Data portability ->","completion":" D. The principle of data portability says that the data subject has the right to receive personal information and to transfer that information to another data controller. The principle of data integrity states that data should be reliable and that information should not be used for purposes other than those that users are made aware of by notice and that they have accepted through choice. Enforcement is aimed at ensuring that compliance with principles is assured. Onward transfer limits transfers to other organizations that comply with the principles of notice and choice.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the best method to sanitize a solid-state drive (SSD)? A. Clearing B. Zero fill C. Disintegration D. Degaussing ->","completion":" C. Due to problems with remnant data, the US National Security Agency requires physical destruction of SSDs. This process, known as disintegration, results in very small fragments via a shredding process.

There is no additional security issue; the VPN concentrator's logical network location matches the logical network location of the workstations. C. Web server traffic is not subjected to stateful inspection. D. VPN users should only connect from managed PCs. ->","completion":" D. Remote PCs that connect to a protected network need to comply with security settings and standards that match those required for the internal network. The VPN concentrator logically places remote users in the protected zone behind the firewall, but that means that user workstations (and users) must be trusted in the same way that local workstations are.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Chris wants to stop cross-site scripting attacks against the web server, what is the best device for this purpose, and where should he put it? A. A firewall, location A B. An IDS, location A C. An IPS, location B D. A WAF, location C ->","completion":" C. An intrusion protection system can scan traffic and stop both known and unknown attacks. A web application firewall, or WAF, is also a suitable technology, but placing it at location C would only protect from attacks via the organization’s VPN, which should only be used by trusted users. A firewall typically won鈥檛 have the ability to identify and stop cross-site scripting attacks, and IDS systems only monitor and don鈥檛 stop attacks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan is deploying a routing protocol that maintains a list of destination networks with metrics that include the distance in hops to them and the direction traffic should be sent to them. What type of protocol is she using? A. A link-state protocol B. A link-distance protocol C. A destination metric protocol D. A distance-vector protocol ->","completion":" D. Distance-vector protocols use metrics including the direction and distance in hops to remote networks to make decisions. A link-state routing protocol considers the shortest distance to a remote network. Destination metric and link-distance protocols don鈥檛 exist.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben has configured his network to not broadcast an SSID. Why might Ben disable SSID broadcast, and how could his SSID be discovered? A. Disabling SSID broadcast prevents attackers from discovering the encryption key. The SSID can be recovered from decrypted packets. B. Disabling SSID broadcast hides networks from unauthorized personnel. The SSID can be discovered using a wireless sniffer. C. Disabling SSID broadcast prevents issues with beacon frames. The SSID can be recovered by reconstructing the BSSID. D. Disabling SSID broadcast helps avoid SSID conflicts. The SSID can be discovered by attempting to connect to the network. ->","completion":" B. Disabling SSID broadcast can help prevent unauthorized personnel from attempting to connect to the network. Since the SSID is still active, it can be discovered by using a wireless sniffer. Encryption keys are not related to SSID broadcast, beacon frames are used to broadcast the SSID, and it is possible to have multiple networks with the same SSID.\n"}
{"prompt":"What network tool can be used to protect the identity of clients while providing Internet access by accepting client requests, altering the source addresses of the requests, mapping requests to clients, and sending the modified requests out to their destination? A. A gateway B. A proxy C. A router D. A firewall ->","completion":" B. A proxy is a form of gateway that provide clients with a filtering, caching, or other service that protects their information from remote systems. A router connects networks, while a firewall uses rules to limit traffic permitted through it. A gateway translates between protocols.\n"}
{"prompt":"During troubleshooting, Chris uses the nslookup command to check the IP address of a host he is attempting to connect to. The IP he sees in the response is not the IP that should resolve when the lookup is done. What type of attack has likely been conducted? A. DNS spoofing B. DNS poisoning C. ARP spoofing D. A Cain attack ->","completion":" B. DNS poisoning occurs when an attacker changes the domain name to IP address mappings of a system to redirect traffic to alternate systems. DNS spoofing occurs when an attacker sends false replies to a requesting system, beating valid replies from the actual DNS server. ARP spoofing provides a false hardware address in response to queries about an IP, and Cain & Abel is a powerful Windows hacking tool, but a Cain attack is not a specific type of attack.\n"}
{"prompt":"A remote access tool that copies what is displayed on a desktop PC to a remote computer is an example of what type of technology? A. Remote node operation B. Screen scraping C. Remote control D. RDP ->","completion":" B. Screen scrapers copy the actual screen displayed and display it at a remote location. RDP provides terminal sessions without doing screen scraping, remote node operation is the same as dial-up access, and remote control is a means of controlling a remote system (screen scraping is a specialized subset of remote control).\n"}
{"prompt":"Which email security solution provides two major usage modes: (1) signed messages that provide integrity, sender authentication, and nonrepudiation; and (2) an enveloped message mode that provides integrity, sender authentication, and confidentiality? A. S\/MIME B. MOSS C. PEM D. DKIM ->","completion":" A. S\/MIME supports both signed messages and a secure envelope method. While the functionality of S\/MIME can be replicated with other tools, the secure envelope is an S\/MIME-specific concept. MOSS, or MIME Object Security Services, and PEM can also both provide authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and nonrepudiation, while DKIM, or Domain Keys Identified Mail, is a domain validation tool.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a security assessment, Jim discovers that the organization he is working with uses a multilayer protocol to handle SCADA systems and recently connected the SCADA network to the rest of the organization's production network. What concern should he raise about serial data transfers carried via TCP\/IP? A. SCADA devices that are now connected to the network can now be attacked over the network. B. Serial data over TCP\/IP cannot be encrypted. C. Serial data cannot be carried in TCP packets. D. TCP\/IP's throughput can allow for easy denial of service attacks against serial devices. ->","completion":" A. Multilayer protocols like DNP3 allow SCADA and other systems to use TCP\/IP-based networks to communicate. Many SCADA devices were never designed to be exposed to a network, and adding them to a potentially insecure network can create significant risks. TLS or other encryption can be used on TCP packets, meaning that even serial data can be protected. Serial data can be carried via TCP packets because TCP packets don鈥檛 care about their content; it is simply another payload. Finally, TCP\/IP does not have a specific throughput as designed, so issues with throughput are device-level issues.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of key does WEP use to encrypt wireless communications? A. An asymmetric key B. Unique key sets for each host C. A predefined shared static key D. Unique asymmetric keys for each host ->","completion":" C. WEP has a very weak security model that relies on a single, predefined, shared static key. This means that modern attacks can break WEP encryption in less than a minute.\n"}
{"prompt":"Arnold is receiving reports from end users that their internet connections are extremely slow. He looks at the firewall and determines that there are thousands of unexpected inbound connections per second arriving from all over the world. What type of attack is most likely occurring? A. A worm B. A denial of service attack C. A virus D. A smurf attack ->","completion":" B. A denial of service attack is an attack that causes a service to fail or to be unavailable. Exhausting a system’s resources to cause a service to fail is a common form of denial of service attack. A worm is a self-replicating form of malware that propagates via a network, a virus is a type of malware that can copy itself to spread, and a smurf attack is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) that spoofs a victim’s IP address to systems using an IP broadcast, resulting in traffic from all of those systems to the target.\n"}
{"prompt":"What speed and frequency range is used by 802.11n? A. 54 Mbps, 5 GHz B. 200+ Mbps, 5GHz C. 200+ Mbps, 2.4 and 5 GHz D. 1 Gbps, 5 GHz ->","completion":" C. 802.11n can operate at speeds over 200 Mbps, and it can operate on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequency range. 802.11g operates at 54 Mbps using the 2.4 GHz frequency range, and 802.11ac is capable of 1 Gbps using the 5 GHz range. 802.11a and b are both outdated and are unlikely to be encountered in modern network installations.\n"}
{"prompt":"The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) operate at what layer of the OSI model? A. Layer 1 B. Layer 2 C. Layer 3 D. Layer 4 ->","completion":" B. ARP and RARP operate at the Data Link layer, the second layer of the OSI model. Both protocols deal with physical hardware addresses, which are used above the Physical layer (layer 1) and below the Network layer (layer 3), thus falling at the Data Link layer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is a converged protocol that allows storage mounts over TCP, and which is frequently used as a lower-cost alternative to Fibre Channel? A. MPLS B. SDN C. VoIP D. iSCSI ->","completion":" D. iSCSI is a converged protocol that allows location-independent file services over traditional network technologies. It costs less than traditional Fibre Channel. VoIP is Voice over IP, SDN is software-defined networking, and MPLS is Multiprotocol Label Switching, a technology that uses path labels instead of network addresses.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris is building an Ethernet network and knows that he needs to span a distance of more than 150 meters with his 1000BaseT network. What network technology should he use to help with this? A. Install a repeater or a concentrator before 100 meters. B. Use Category 7 cable, which has better shielding for higher speeds. C. Install a gateway to handle the distance. D. Use STP cable to handle the longer distance at high speeds. ->","completion":" A. A repeater or concentrator will amplify the signal, ensuring that the 100-meter distance limitation of 1000BaseT is not an issue. A gateway would be useful if network protocols were changing, while Cat7 cable is appropriate for a 10Gbps network at much shorter distances. STP cable is limited to 155 Mbps and 100 meters, which would leave Chris with network problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"What protocol is the messaging traffic most likely to use based on the diagram? A. SLACK B. HTTP C. SMTP D. HTTPS ->","completion":" B. The use of TCP port 80 indicates that the messaging service is using the HTTP protocol. Slack is a messaging service that runs over HTTPS, which uses port 443. SMTP is an email protocol that uses port 25.\n"}
{"prompt":"What security concern does sending internal communications from A to B raise? A. The firewall does not protect system B. B. System C can see the broadcast traffic from system A to B. C. It is traveling via an unencrypted protocol. D. Messaging does not provide nonrepudation. ->","completion":" C. HTTP traffic is typically sent via TCP 80. Unencrypted HTTP traffic can be easily captured at any point between A and B, meaning that the messaging solution chosen does not provide confidentiality for the organization’s corporate communications.\n"}
{"prompt":"How could Lauren's company best address a desire for secure messaging for users of internal systems A and C? A. Use a third-party messaging service. B. Implement and use a locally hosted service. C. Use HTTPS. D. Discontinue use of messaging and instead use email, which is more secure. ->","completion":" B. If a business need requires messaging, using a local messaging server is the best option. This prevents traffic from traveling to a third-party server and can offer additional benefits such as logging, archiving, and control of security options like the use of encryption.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following drawbacks is a concern when multilayer protocols are allowed? A. A range of protocols may be used at higher layers. B. Covert channels are allowed. C. Filters cannot be bypassed. D. Encryption can't be incorporated at multiple layers. ->","completion":" B. Multilayer protocols create three primary concerns for security practitioners: They can conceal covert channels (and thus covert channels are allowed), filters can be bypassed by traffic concealed in layered protocols, and the logical boundaries put in place by network segments can be bypassed under some circumstances. Multilayer protocols allow encryption at various layers and support a range of protocols at higher layers.\n"}
{"prompt":"What network topology is shown in the following image? A. A ring B. A star C. A bus D. A mesh ->","completion":" C. A bus can be linear or tree-shaped and connects each system to trunk or backbone cable. Ethernet networks operate on a bus topology.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris uses a cellular hot spot (modem) to provide internet access when he is traveling. If he leaves the hot spot connected to his PC while his PC is on his organization's corporate network, what security issue might he cause? A. Traffic may not be routed properly, exposing sensitive data. B. His system may act as a bridge from the internet to the local network. C. His system may be a portal for a reflected DDoS attack. D. Security administrators may not be able to determine his IP address if a security issue occurs. ->","completion":" B. When a workstation or other device is connected simultaneously to both a secure and a nonsecure network like the Internet, it may act as a bridge, bypassing the security protections located at the edge of a corporate network. It is unlikely that traffic will be routed improperly leading to the exposure of sensitive data, as traffic headed to internal systems and networks is unlikely to be routed to the external network. Reflected DDoS attacks are used to hide identities rather than to connect through to an internal network, and security administrators of managed systems should be able to determine both the local and wireless IP addresses his system uses.\n"}
{"prompt":"In her role as an information security professional, Susan has been asked to identify areas where her organization's wireless network may be accessible even though it isn't intended to be. What should Susan do to determine where her organization's wireless network is accessible? A. A site survey B. Warwalking C. Wardriving D. A design map ->","completion":" A. Wardriving and warwalking are both processes used to locate wireless networks, but are not typically as detailed and thorough as a site survey, and design map is a made-up term.\n"}
{"prompt":"The DARPA TCP\/IP model's Application layer matches up to what three OSI model layers? A. Application, Presentation, and Transport. B. Presentation, Session, and Transport. C. Application, Presentation, and Session. D. There is not a direct match. The TCP model was created before the OSI model. ->","completion":" C. The DARPA TCP\/IP model was used to create the OSI model, and the designers of the OSI model made sure to map the OSI model layers to it. The Application layer of the TCP model maps to the Application, Presentation, and Session layers, while the TCP and OSI models both have a distinct Transport layer.\n"}
{"prompt":"One of Susan's attacks during a penetration test involves inserting false ARP data into a system's ARP cache. When the system attempts to send traffic to the address it believes belongs to a legitimate system, it will instead send that traffic to a system she controls. What is this attack called? A. RARP flooding B. ARP cache poisoning C. A denial of ARP attack D. ARP buffer blasting ->","completion":" B. ARP cache poisoning occurs when false ARP data is inserted into a system’s ARP cache, allowing the attacker to modify its behavior. RARP flooding, denial of ARP attacks, and ARP buffer blasting are all made-up terms.\n"}
{"prompt":"Sue modifies her MAC address to one that is allowed on a network that uses MAC filtering to provide security. What is the technique Sue used, and what nonsecurity issue could her actions cause? A. Broadcast domain exploit, address conflict B. Spoofing, token loss C. Spoofing, address conflict D. Sham EUI creation, token loss ->","completion":" C. The process of using a fake MAC (Media Access Control) address is called spoofing, and spoofing a MAC address already in use on the network can lead to an address collision, preventing traffic from reaching one or both systems. Tokens are used in token ring networks, which are outdated, and EUI refers to an Extended Unique Identifier, another term for MAC address, but token loss is still not the key issue. Broadcast domains refers to the set of machines a host can send traffic to via a broadcast message.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim's audit of a large organization's traditional PBX showed that Direct Inward System Access (DISA) was being abused by third parties. What issue is most likely to lead to this problem? A. The PBX was not fully patched. B. The dial-in modem lines use unpublished numbers. C. DISA is set up to only allow local calls. D. One or more users' access codes have been compromised. ->","completion":" D. Direct Inward System Access uses access codes assigned to users to add a control layer for external access and control of the PBX. If the codes are compromised, attackers can make calls through the PBX or even control it. Not updating a PBX can lead to a range of issues, but this question is looking for a DISA issue. Allowing only local calls and using unpublished numbers are both security controls and might help keep the PBX more secure.\n"}
{"prompt":"SMTP, HTTP, and SNMP all occur at what layer of the OSI model? A. Layer 4 B. Layer 5 C. Layer 6 D. Layer 7 ->","completion":" D. Application-specific protocols are handled at layer 7, the Application layer of the OSI model.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren uses the ping utility to check whether a remote system is up as part of a penetration testing exercise. If she does not want to see her own ping packets, what protocol should she filter out from her packet sniffer's logs? A. UDP B. TCP C. IP D. ICMP ->","completion":" D. Ping uses ICMP, the Internet Control Message Protocol, to determine whether a system responds and how many hops there are between the originating system and the remote system. Lauren simply needs to filter out ICMP to not see her pings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren wants to provide port-based authentication on her network to ensure that clients must authenticate before using the network. What technology is an appropriate solution for this requirement? A. 802.11a B. 802.3 C. 802.15.1 D. 802.1x ->","completion":" D. 802.1x provides port-based authentication and can be used with technologies like EAP, the Extensible Authentication Protocol. 802.11a is a wireless standard, 802.3 is the standard for Ethernet, and 802.15.1 was the original Bluetooth IEEE standard.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben has deployed a 1000BaseT 1 gigabit network and needs to run a cable to another building. If Ben is running his link directly from a switch to another switch in that building, what is the maximum distance Ben can cover according to the 1000BaseT specification? A. 2 kilometers B. 500 meters C. 185 meters D. 100 meters ->","completion":" D. 1000BaseT is capable of a 100-meter run according to its specifications. For longer distances, a fiber-optic cable is typically used in modern networks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim is building the network for a remote site that only has ISDN as an option for connectivity. What type of ISDN should he look for to get the maximum speed possible? A. BRI B. BPRI C. PRI D. D channel ->","completion":" C. PRI, or Primary Rate Interface, can use between 2 and 23 64 Kbps channels, with a maximum potential bandwidth of 1.544 Mbps. Actual speeds will be lower due to the D channel, which can鈥檛 be used for actual data transmission, but PRI beats BRI’s two B channels paired with a D channel for 144 Kbps of bandwidth.\n"}
{"prompt":"SPIT attacks target what technology? A. Virtualization platforms B. Web services C. VoIP systems D. Secure Process Internal Transfers ->","completion":" C. SPIT stands for Spam over Internet Telephony and targets VoIP systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"What does a bluesnarfing attack target? A. Data on IBM systems B. An outbound phone call via Bluetooth C. 802.11b networks D. Data from a Bluetooth-enabled device ->","completion":" D. Bluesnarfing targets the data or information on Bluetooth-enabled devices. Bluejacking occurs when attackers send unsolicited messages via Bluetooth.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following options includes standards or protocols that exist in layer 6 of the OSI model? A. NFS, SQL, and RPC B. TCP, UDP, and TLS C. JPEG, ASCII, and MIDI D. HTTP, FTP, and SMTP ->","completion":" C. Layer 6, the Presentation layer, transforms data from the Application layer into formats that other systems can understand by formatting and standardizing the data. That means that standards like JPEG, ASCII, and MIDI are used at the Presentation layer for data. TCP, UDP, and TLS are used at the Transport layer; NFS, SQL, and RPC operate at the Session layer; and HTTP, FTP, and SMTP are Application layer protocols.\n"}
{"prompt":"What network topology is shown here? A. A ring B. A bus C. A star D. A mesh ->","completion":" D. Fully connected mesh networks provide each system with a direct physical link to every other system in the mesh. This is very expensive but can provide performance advantages for specific types of computational work.\n"}
{"prompt":"There are four common VPN protocols. Which group listed contains all of the common VPN protocols? A. PPTP, LTP, L2TP, IPsec B. PPP, L2TP, IPsec, VNC C. PPTP, L2F, L2TP, IPsec D. PPTP, L2TP, IPsec, SPAP ->","completion":" C. PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPsec are the most common VPN protocols. TLS is also used for an increasingly large percentage of VPN connections and may appear at some point in the CISSP exam. PPP is a dial-up protocol, LTP is not a protocol, and SPAP is the Shiva Password Authentication Protocol sometimes used with PPTP.\n"}
{"prompt":"What network technology is best described as a token-passing network that uses a pair of rings with traffic flowing in opposite directions? A. A ring topology B. Token Ring C. FDDI D. SONET ->","completion":" C. FDDI, or Fiber Distributed Data Interface, is a token-passing network that uses a pair of rings with traffic flowing in opposite directions. It can bypass broken segments by dropping the broken point and using the second, unbroken ring to continue to function. Token Ring also uses tokens, but it does not use a dual loop. SONET is a protocol for sending multiple optical streams over fiber, and a ring topology is a design, not a technology\n"}
{"prompt":"Which OSI layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and interface standards? A. The Transport layer B. The Device layer C. The Physical layer D. The Data Link layer ->","completion":" C. The Physical layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and standards that allow control of throughput, handling line noise, and a variety of other electrical interface and signaling requirements. The OSI layer doesn't have a Device layer. The Transport layer connects the Network and Session layers, and the Data Link layer packages packets from the network layer for transmission and receipt by devices operating on the Physical layer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben is designing a Wi-Fi network and has been asked to choose the most secure option for the network. Which wireless security standard should he choose? A. WPA2 B. WPA C. WEP D. AES ->","completion":" A. WPA2, the replacement for WPA, does not suffer from the security issues that WEP, the original wireless security protocol, and WPA, its successor, both suffer from. AES is used in WPA2 but is not specifically a wireless security standard.\n"}
{"prompt":"If your organization needs to allow attachments in email to support critical business processes, what are the two best options for helping to avoid security problems caused by attachments? A. Train your users and use antimalware tools. B. Encrypt your email and use antimalware tools. C. Train your users and require S\/MIME for all email. D. Use S\/MIME by default and remove all ZIP (.zip) file attachments. ->","completion":" A. User awareness is one of the most important tools when dealing with attachments. Attachments are often used as a vector for malware, and aware users can help prevent successful attacks by not opening the attachments. Antimalware tools, including antivirus software, can help detect known threats before users even see the attachments. Encryption, including tools like S\/MIME, won't help prevent attachment-based security problems, and removing ZIP file attachments will only stop malware that is sent via those ZIP files.\n"}
{"prompt":"Segmentation, sequencing, and error checking all occur at what layer of the OSI model that is associated with SSL, TLS, and UDP? A. The Transport layer B. The Network layer C. The Session layer D. The Presentation layer ->","completion":" A. The Transport layer provides logical connections between devices, including end-toend transport services to ensure that data is delivered. Transport layer protocols include TCP, UDP, SSL, and TLS.\n"}
{"prompt":"The Windows ipconfig command displays the following information: BC-5F-F4-7B-4B-7D What term describes this, and what information can usually be gathered from it? A. The IP address, the network location of the system B. The MAC address, the network interface card's manufacturer C. The MAC address, the media type in use D. The IPv6 client ID, the network interface card's manufacturer ->","completion":" B. Machine Access Control (MAC) addresses are the hardware address the machine uses for layer 2 communications. The MAC addresses include an organizationally unique identifier (OUI), which identifies the manufacturer. MAC addresses can be changed, so this is not a guarantee of accuracy, but under normal circumstances you can tell what manufacturer made the device by using the MAC address.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris has been asked to choose between implementing PEAP and LEAP for wireless authentication. What should he choose, and why? A. LEAP, because it fixes problems with TKIP, resulting in stronger security B. PEAP, because it implements CCMP for security C. LEAP, because it implements EAP-TLS for end-to-end session encryption D. PEAP, because it can provide a TLS tunnel that encapsulates EAP methods, protecting the entire session ->","completion":" D. PEAP provides encryption for EAP methods and can provide authentication. It does not implement CCMP, which was included in the WPA2 standard. LEAP is dangerously insecure and should not be used due to attack tools that have been available since the early 2000s.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben is troubleshooting a network and discovers that the NAT router he is connected to has the 192.168.x.x subnet as its internal network and that its external IP is 192.168.1.40. What problem is he encountering? A. 192.168.x.x is a nonroutable network and will not be carried to the Internet. B. 192.168.1.40 is not a valid address because it is reserved by RFC 1918. C. Double NATing is not possible using the same IP range. D. The upstream system is unable to de-encapsulate his packets and he needs to use PAT instead. ->","completion":" C. Double NATing isn't possible with the same IP range; the same IP addresses cannot appear inside and outside a NAT router. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved, but only so they are not used and routable on the Internet, and changing to PAT would not fix the issue.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the default subnet mask for a Class B network? A. 255.0.0.0 B. 255.255.0.0 C. 255.254.0.0 D. 255.255.255.0 ->","completion":" B. A Class B network holds 2^16 systems, and its default network mask is 255.255.0.0.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim's organization uses a traditional PBX for voice communication. What is the most common security issue that its internal communications are likely to face, and what should he recommend to prevent it? A. Eavesdropping, encryption B. Man-in-the-middle attacks, end-to-end encryption C. Eavesdropping, physical security D. Wardialing, deploy an IPS ->","completion":" C. Traditional private branch exchange (PBX) systems are vulnerable to eavesdropping because voice communications are carried directly over copper wires. Since standard telephones don't provide encryption (and you're unlikely to add encrypted phones unless you're the NSA), physically securing access to the lines and central connection points is the best strategy available.\n"}
{"prompt":"What common security issue is often overlooked with cordless phones? A. Their signal is rarely encrypted and thus can be easily monitored. B. They use unlicensed frequencies. C. They can allow attackers access to wireless networks. D. They are rarely patched and are vulnerable to malware. ->","completion":" A. Most cordless phones don't use encryption, and even modern phones that use DECT (which does provide encryption) have already been cracked. This means that a determined attacker can almost always eavesdrop on cordless phones, and makes them a security risk if they're used for confidential communication.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren's organization has deployed VoIP phones on the same switches that the desktop PCs are on. What security issue could this create, and what solution would help? A. VLAN hopping; use physically separate switches. B. VLAN hopping; use encryption. C. Caller ID spoofing; MAC filtering. D. Denial of service attacks; use a firewall between networks. ->","completion":" A. VLAN hopping between the voice and computer VLANs can be accomplished when devices share the same switch infrastructure. Using physically separate switches can prevent this attack. Encryption won't help with VLAN hopping because it relies on header data that the switch needs to read (and this is unencrypted), while Caller ID spoofing is an inherent problem with VoIP systems. A denial of service is always a possibility, but it isn't specifically a VoIP issue and a firewall may not stop the problem if it's on a port that must be allowed through.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following rules is not shown in the rulebase but will be enforced by the firewall? A. Stealth B. Implicit deny C. Connection proxy D. Egress filter ->","completion":" B. All stateful inspection firewalls enforce an implicit deny rule as the final rule of the rulebase. It is designed to drop all inbound traffic that was not accepted by an earlier rule. Stealth rules hide the firewall from external networks, but they are not included by default. This firewall does not contain any egress filtering rules, and egress filtering is not enforced by default. Connection proxying is an optional feature of stateful inspection firewalls and would not be enforced without a rule explicitly implementing it.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of server is running at IP address 10.1.0.26? A. Email B. Web C. FTP D. Database ->","completion":" A. SMTP uses ports 25 and 465. The presence of an inbound rule allowing SMTP traffic indicates that this is an email server.\n"}
{"prompt":"The system at 15.246.10.1 attempts HTTP and HTTPS connections to the web server running at 10.1.0.50. Which one of the following statements is true about that connection? A. Both connections will be allowed. B. Both connections will be blocked. C. The HTTP connection will be allowed, and the HTTPS connection will be blocked. D. The HTTP connection will be blocked, and the HTTPS connection will be allowed. ->","completion":" C. The HTTP connection will be allowed, despite the presence of rule #2, because it matches rule #1. The HTTPS connection will be blocked because there is no rule allowing HTTPS connections to this server.\n"}
{"prompt":"What value should be used to fill in the source port for rule #3? A. 25 B. 465 C. 80 D. Any ->","completion":" D. The firewall should be configured to accept inbound connections from any port selected by the source system. The vast majority of inbound firewall rules allow access from any source port.\n"}
{"prompt":"Data streams occur at what three layers of the OSI model? A. Application, Presentation, and Session B. Presentation, Session, and Transport C. Physical, Data Link, and Network D. Data Link, Network, and Transport ->","completion":" A. Data streams are associated with the Application, Presentation, and Session layers. Once they reach the Transport layer, they become segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). From there, they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer, and bits at the Physical layer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris needs to design a firewall architecture that can support a DMZ, a database, and a private internal network in a secure manner that separates each function. What type of design should he use, and how many firewalls does he need? A. A four-tier firewall design with two firewalls B. A two-tier firewall design with three firewalls C. A three-tier firewall design with at least one firewall D. A single-tier firewall design with three firewalls ->","completion":" C. A three-tier design separates three distinct protected zones and can be accomplished with a single firewall that has multiple interfaces. Single- and two-tier designs don't support the number of protected networks needed in this scenario, while a four-tier design would provide a tier that isn't needed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren's networking team has been asked to identify a technology that will allow them to dynamically change the organization's network by treating the network like code. What type of architecture should she recommend? A. A network that follows the 5-4-3 rule B. A converged network C. A software-defined network D. A hypervisor-based network ->","completion":" C. Software-defined networking provides a network architecture that can be defined and configured as code or software. This will allow Lauren's team to quickly change the network based on organizational requirements. The 5-4-3 rule is an old design rule for networks that relied on repeaters or hubs. A converged network carries multiple types of traffic like voice, video, and data. A hypervisor-based network may be software defined, but it could also use traditional network devices running as virtual machines.\n"}
{"prompt":"Cable modems, ISDN, and DSL are all examples of what type of technology? A. Baseband B. Broadband C. Digital D. Broadcast ->","completion":" B. ISDN, cable modems, DSL, and T1 and T3 lines are all examples of broadband technology that can support multiple simultaneous signals. They are analog, not digital, and are not broadcast technologies.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of firewall design is shown in the following image? A. Single tier B. Two tier C. Three tier D. Next generation ->","completion":" A. A single-tier firewall deployment is very simple and does not offer useful design options like a DMZ or separate transaction subnets.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a review of her organization's network, Angela discovered that it was suffering from broadcast storms and that contractors, guests, and organizational administrative staff were on the same network segment. What design change should Angela recommend? A. Require encryption for all users. B. Install a firewall at the network border. C. Enable spanning tree loop detection. D. Segment the network based on functional requirements. ->","completion":" D. Network segmentation can reduce issues with performance as well as diminish the chance of broadcast storms by limiting the number of systems in a segment. This decreases broadcast traffic visible to each system and can reduce congestion. Segmentation can also help provide security by separating functional groups who don't need to be able to access each other's systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and outbound traffic, not cross-network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues. Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm!\n"}
{"prompt":"ICMP, RIP, and network address translation all occur at what layer of the OSI model? A. Layer 1 B. Layer 2 C. Layer 3 D. Layer 4 ->","completion":" C. ICMP, RIP, and network address translation all occur at layer 3, the Network layer.\n"}
{"prompt":"The IDS Ben is responsible for is used to monitor communications in the data center using a mirrored port on the data center switch. What traffic will Ben see once the majority of servers in the data center have been virtualized? A. The same traffic he currently sees B. All inter-VM traffic C. Only traffic sent outside the VM environment D. All inter-hypervisor traffic ->","completion":" C. One of the visibility risks of virtualization is that communication between servers and systems using virtual interfaces can occur \"inside\" the virtual environment. This means that visibility into traffic in the virtualization environment has to be purpose-built as part of its design. Option D is correct but incomplete because inter-hypervisor traffic isn't the only traffic the IDS will see.\n"}
{"prompt":"The VM administrators recommend enabling cut and paste between virtual machines. What security concern should Ben raise about this practice? A. It can cause a denial of service condition. B. It can serve as a covert channel. C. It can allow viruses to spread. D. It can bypass authentication controls. ->","completion":" B. Cut and paste between virtual machines can bypass normal network-based data loss prevention tools and monitoring tools like an IDS or IPS. Thus, it can act as a covert channel, allowing the transport of data between security zones. So far, cut and paste has not been used as a method for malware spread in virtual environments and has not been associated with denial of service attacks. Cut and paste requires users to be logged in and does not bypass authentication requirements.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben is concerned about exploits that allow VM escape. What option should Ben suggest to help limit the impact of VM escape exploits? A. Separate virtual machines onto separate physical hardware based on task or data types. B. Use VM escape detection tools on the underlying hypervisor. C. Restore machines to their original snapshots on a regular basis. D. Use a utility like Tripwire to look for changes in the virtual machines. ->","completion":" A. While virtual machine escape has only been demonstrated in laboratory environments, the threat is best dealt with by limiting what access to the underlying hypervisor can prove to a successful tracker. Segmenting by data types or access levels can limit the potential impact of a hypervisor compromise. If attackers can access the underlying system, restricting the breach to only similar data types or systems will limit the impact. Escape detection tools are not available on the market, restoring machines to their original snapshots will not prevent the exploit from occurring again, and Tripwire detects file changes and is unlikely to catch exploits that escape the virtual machines themselves.\n"}
{"prompt":"WPA2's Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Mode Protocol (CCMP) is based on which common encryption scheme? A. DES B. 3DES C. AES D. TLS ->","completion":" C. WPA2's CCMP encryption scheme is based on AES. As of the writing of this book, there have not been any practical real-world attacks against WPA2. DES has been successfully broken, and neither 3DES nor TLS is used for WPA2.\n"}
{"prompt":"When a host on an Ethernet network detects a collision and transmits a jam signal, what happens next? A. The host that transmitted the jam signal is allowed to retransmit while all other hosts pause until that transmission is received successfully. B. All hosts stop transmitting, and each host waits a random period of time before attempting to transmit again. C. All hosts stop transmitting, and each host waits a period of time based on how recently it successfully transmitted. D. Hosts wait for the token to be passed and then resume transmitting data as they pass the token. ->","completion":" B. Ethernet networks use Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA\/ CD) technology. When a collision is detected and a jam signal is sent, hosts wait a random period of time before attempting retransmission.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the speed of a T3 line? A. 128 kbps B. 1.544 Mbps C. 44.736 Mbps D. 155 Mbps ->","completion":" C. A T3 (DS-3) line is capable of 44.736 Mbps. This is often referred to as 45 Mbps. A T1 is 1.544 Mbps, ATM is 155 Mbps, and ISDN is often 64 or 128 Kbps.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of firewall design does the following image show? A. A single-tier firewall B. A two-tier firewall C. A three-tier firewall D. A fully protected DMZ firewall ->","completion":" B. A two-tier firewall uses a firewall with multiple interfaces or multiple firewalls in series. This image shows a firewall with two protected interfaces, with one used for a DMZ and one used for a protected network. This allows traffic to be filtered between each of the zones (Internet, DMZ, and private network).\n"}
{"prompt":"What challenge is most common for endpoint security system deployments? A. Compromises B. The volume of data C. Monitoring encrypted traffic on the network D. Handling non-TCP protocols ->","completion":" B. Endpoint security solutions face challenges due to the sheer volume of data that they can create. When each workstation is generating data about events, this can be a massive amount of data. Endpoint security solutions should reduce the number of compromises when properly implemented, and they can also help by monitoring traffic after it is decrypted on the local host. Finally, non-TCP protocols are relatively uncommon on modern networks, making this a relatively rare concern for endpoint security system implementations.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of address is 127.0.0.1? A. A public IP address B. An RFC 1918 address C. An APIPA address D. A loopback address ->","completion":" D. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address and will resolve to the local machine. Public addresses are non-RFC 1918, non-reserved addresses. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved and include ranges like 10.x.x.x. An APIPA address is a self-assigned address used when a DHCP server cannot be found.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan is writing a best practices statement for her organizational users who need to use Bluetooth. She knows that there are many potential security issues with Bluetooth and wants to provide the best advice she can. Which of the following sets of guidance should Susan include? A. Use Bluetooth's built-in strong encryption, change the default PIN on your device, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. B. Use Bluetooth only for those activities that are not confidential, change the default PIN on your device, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. C. Use Bluetooth's built-in strong encryption, use extended (8 digit or longer) Bluetooth PINs, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. D. Use Bluetooth only for those activities that are not confidential, use extended (8 digit or longer) Bluetooth PINs, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. ->","completion":" B. Since Bluetooth doesn't provide strong encryption, it should only be used for activities that are not confidential. Bluetooth PINs are four-digit codes that often default to 0000. Turning it off and ensuring that your devices are not in discovery mode can help prevent Bluetooth attacks.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of networking device is most commonly used to assign endpoint systems to VLANs? A. Firewall B. Router C. Switch D. Hub ->","completion":" C. The assignment of endpoint systems to VLANs is normally performed by a network switch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Steve has been tasked with implementing a network storage protocol over an IP network. What storage-centric converged protocol is he likely to use in his implementation? A. MPLS B. FCoE C. SDN D. VoIP ->","completion":" B. Fibre Channel over Ethernet allows Fibre Channel communications over Ethernet networks, allowing existing high-speed networks to be used to carry storage traffic. This avoids the cost of a custom cable plant for a Fibre Channel implementation. MPLS, or Multiprotocol Label Switching, is used for high performance networking; VoIP is Voice over IP; and SDN is software-defined networking.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of network device modulates between an analog carrier signal and digital information for computer communications? A. A bridge B. A router C. A brouter D. A modem ->","completion":" D. A modem (MOdulator\/DEModulator) modulates between an analog carrier like a phone line and digital communications like those used between computers. While modems aren't in heavy use in most areas, they are still in place for system control and remote system contact and in areas where phone lines are available but other forms of communication are too expensive or not available.\n"}
{"prompt":"A denial of service (DoS) attack that sends fragmented TCP packets is known as what kind of attack? A. Christmas tree B. Teardrop C. Stack killer D. Frag grenade ->","completion":" B. A teardrop attack uses fragmented packets to target a flaw in how the TCP stack on a system handles fragment reassembly. If the attack is successful, the TCP stack fails, resulting in a denial of service. Christmas tree attacks set all of the possible TCP flags on a packet, thus \"lighting it up like a Christmas tree.\" Stack killer and frag grenade attacks are made-up answers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Phillip maintains a modem bank in support of several legacy services used by his organization. Which one of the following protocols is most appropriate for this purpose? A. SLIP B. SLAP C. PPTP D. PPP ->","completion":" D. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is used for dial-up connections for modems, IDSN, Frame Relay, and other technologies. It replaced SLIP in almost all cases. PPTP is the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol used for VPNs, and SLAP is not a protocol at all!\n"}
{"prompt":"One of the findings that Jim made when performing a security audit was the use of non-IP protocols in a private network. What issue should Jim point out that may result from the use of these non-IP protocols? A. They are outdated and cannot be used on modern PCs. B. They may not be able to be filtered by firewall devices. C. They may allow Christmas tree attacks. D. IPX extends on the IP protocol and may not be supported by all TCP stacks. ->","completion":" B. While non-IP protocols like IPX\/SPX, NetBEUI, and AppleTalk are rare in modern networks, they can present a challenge because many firewalls are not capable of filtering them. This can create risks when they are necessary for an application or system's function  because they may have to be passed without any inspection. Christmas tree attacks set all of the possible flags on a TCP packet (and are thus related to an IP protocol), IPX is not an IP-based protocol, and while these protocols are outdated, there are ways to make even modern PCs understand them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Angela needs to choose between EAP, PEAP, and LEAP for secure authentication. Which authentication protocol should she choose and why? A. EAP, because it provides strong encryption by default B. LEAP, because it provides frequent reauthentication and changing of WEP keys C. PEAP, because it provides encryption and doesn't suffer from the same vulnerabilities that LEAP does D. None of these options can provide secure authentication, and an alternate solution should be chosen. ->","completion":" C. Of the three answers, PEAP is the best solution. It encapsulates EAP in a TLS tunnel, providing strong encryption. LEAP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that was originally designed to help deal with problems in WEP. LEAP's protections have been defeated, making it a poor choice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren has been asked to replace her organization's PPTP implementation with an L2TP implementation for security reasons. What is the primary security reason that L2TP would replace PPTP? A. L2TP can use IPsec. B. L2TP creates a point-to-point tunnel, avoiding multipoint issues. C. PPTP doesn't support EAP. D. PPTP doesn't properly encapsulate PPP packets. ->","completion":" A. L2TP can use IPsec to provide encryption of traffic, ensuring confidentiality of the traffic carried via an L2TP VPN. PPTP sends the initial packets of a session in plaintext, potentially including usernames and hashed passwords. PPTP does support EAP and was designed to encapsulate PPP packets. All VPNs are point to point, and multipoint issues are not a VPN problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim is building a research computing system that benefits from being part of a full mesh topology between systems. In a five-node full mesh topology design, how many connections will an individual node have? A. Two B. Three C. Four D. Five ->","completion":" C. A full mesh topology directly connects each machine to every other machine on the network. For five systems, this means four connections per system.\n"}
{"prompt":"What topology correctly describes Ethernet? A. A ring B. A star C. A mesh D. A bus ->","completion":" D. Ethernet uses a bus topology. While devices may be physically connected to a switch in a physical topology that looks like a star, systems using Ethernet can all transmit on the bus simultaneously, possibly leading to collisions.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of attack is most likely to occur after a successful ARP spoofing attempt? A. A DoS attack B. A Trojan C. A replay attack D. A man-in-the-middle attack ->","completion":" D. ARP spoofing is often done to replace a target's cache entry for a destination IP, allowing the attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. A denial of service attack would be aimed at disrupting services rather than spoofing an ARP response, a replay attack will involve existing sessions, and a Trojan is malware that is disguised in a way that makes it look harmless.\n"}
{"prompt":"What speed is Category 3 UTP cable rated for? A. 5 Mbps B. 10 Mbps C. 100 Mbps D. 1000 Mbps ->","completion":" B. Category 3 UTP cable is primarily used for phone cables and was also used for early Ethernet networks where it provided 10 Mbps of throughput. Cat 5 cable provides 100 Mbps (and 1000 Mbps if it is Cat 5e). Cat 6 cable can also provide 1000 Mbps.\n"}
{"prompt":"What issue occurs when data transmitted over one set of wires is picked up by another set of wires? A. Magnetic interference B. Crosstalk C. Transmission absorption D. Amplitude modulation ->","completion":" B. Crosstalk occurs when data transmitted on one set of wires is picked up on another set of wires. Interference like this is electromagnetic rather than simply magnetic, transmission absorption is a made-up term, and amplitude modulation is how AM radio works.\n"}
{"prompt":"What two key issues with the implementation of RC4 make Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) even weaker than it might otherwise be? A. Its use of a static common key and client-set encryption algorithms B. Its use of a static common key and a limited number of initialization vectors C. Its use of weak asymmetric keys and a limited number of initialization vectors D. Its use of a weak asymmetric key and client-set encryption algorithms ->","completion":" B. WEP's implementation of RC4 is weakened by its use of a static common key and a limited number of initialization vectors. It does not use asymmetric encryption, and clients do not select encryption algorithms.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris is setting up a hotel network and needs to ensure that systems in each room or suite can connect to each other, but systems in other suites or rooms cannot. At the same time, he needs to ensure that all systems in the hotel can reach the internet. What solution should he recommend as the most effective business solution? A. Per-room VPNs B. VLANs C. Port security D. Firewalls ->","completion":" B. VLANs can be used to logically separate groups of network ports while still providing access to an uplink. Per-room VPNs would create significant overhead for support as well as create additional expenses. Port security is used to limit what systems can connect to ports, but it doesn't provide network security between systems. Finally, while firewalls might work, they would add additional expense and complexity without adding any benefits over a VLAN solution.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a forensic investigation, Charles is able to determine the Media Access Control address of a system that was connected to a compromised network. Charles knows that MAC addresses are tied back to a manufacturer or vendor and are part of the fingerprint of the system. To which OSI layer does a MAC address belong? A. The Application layer B. The Session layer C. The Physical layer D. The Data Link layer ->","completion":" D. MAC addresses and their organizationally unique identifiers are used at the Data Link layer to identify systems on a network. The Application and Session layers don't care about physical addresses, while the Physical layer involves electrical connectivity and handling physical interfaces rather than addressing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben knows that his organization wants to be able to validate the identity of other organizations based on their domain name when receiving and sending email. What tool should Ben recommend? A. PEM B. S\/MIME C. DKIM D. MOSS ->","completion":" C. Domain Keys Identified Mail, or DKIM, is designed to allow assertions of domain identity to validate email. S\/MIME, PEM, and MOSS are all solutions that can provide authentication, integrity, nonrepudiation, and confidentiality, depending on how they are used.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is best described as an access control model that focuses on subjects and identifies the objects that each subject can access? A. An access control list B. An implicit denial list C. A capability table D. A rights management matrix ->","completion":" C. Capability tables list the privileges assigned to subjects and identify the objects that subjects can access. Access control lists are object-focused rather than subject-focused. Implicit deny is a principle that states that anything that is not explicitly allowed is denied, and a rights management matrix is not an access control model.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim's organization-wide implementation of IDaaS offers broad support for cloud-based applications. Jim's company does not have in-house identity management staff and does not use centralized identity services. Instead, they rely upon Active Directory for AAA services. Which of the following options should Jim recommend to best handle the company's onsite identity needs? A. Integrate onsite systems using OAuth. B. Use an on-premises third-party identity service. C. Integrate onsite systems using SAML. D. Design an in-house solution to handle the organization's unique needs. ->","completion":" B. Since Jim's organization is using a cloud-based identity as a service solution, a thirdparty, on-premises identity service can provide the ability to integrate with the IDaaS solution, and the company's use of Active Directory is widely supported by third-party vendors. OAuth is used to log into third-party websites using existing credentials and would not meet the needs described. SAML is a markup language and would not meet the full set of AAA needs. Since the organization is using Active Directory, a custom in-house solution is unlikely to be as effective as a preexisting third-party solution and may take far more time and expense to implement.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not a weakness in Kerberos? A. The KDC is a single point of failure. B. Compromise of the KDC would allow attackers to impersonate any user. C. Authentication information is not encrypted. D. It is susceptible to password guessing. ->","completion":" C. Kerberos encrypts messages using secret keys, providing protection for authentication traffic. The KDC both is a single point of failure and can cause problems if compromised because keys are stored on the KDC that would allow attackers to impersonate any user. Like many authentication methods, Kerberos can be susceptible to password guessing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Voice pattern recognition is what type of authentication factor? A. Something you know B. Something you have C. Something you are D. Somewhere you are ->","completion":" C. Voice pattern recognition is \"something you are,\" a biometric authentication factor, because it measures a physical characteristic of the individual authenticating.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Susan's organization requires her to log in with her username, a PIN, a password, and a retina scan, how many distinct authentication factor types has she used? A. One B. Two C. Three D. Four ->","completion":" B. Susan has used two distinct types of factors: the PIN and password are both Type 1 factors, and the retina scan is a Type 3 factor. Her username is not a factor.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following items are not commonly associated with restricted interfaces? A. Shells B. Keyboards C. Menus D. Database views ->","completion":" B. Menus, shells, and database views are all commonly used for constrained interfaces. A keyboard is not typically a constrained interface, although physically constrained interfaces like those found on ATMs, card readers, and other devices are common.\n"}

A. A brute-force attack B. A man-in-the-middle attack C. A dictionary attack D. A rainbow table attack ->","completion":" C. Dictionary attacks use a dictionary or list of common passwords as well as variations of those words to attempt to log in as an authorized user. This attack shows a variety of passwords based on a similar base word, which is often a good indicator of a dictionary attack. A brute-force attack will typically show simple iteration of passwords, while a  man-in-the-middle attack would not be visible in the authentication log. A rainbow table attack is used when attackers already have password hashes in their possession and would also not show up in logs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Place the following steps in the order in which they occur during the Kerberos authentication process. A. Client\/server ticket generated B. TGT generated C. Client\/TGS key generated D. User accesses service E. User provides authentication credentials ->","completion":" During the Kerberos authentication process, the steps take place in the following order: E. User provides authentication credentials C. Client\/TGS key generated B. TGT generated A. Client\/server ticket generated D. User accesses service\n"}
{"prompt":"What major issue often results from decentralized access control? A. Access outages may occur. B. Control is not consistent. C. Control is too granular. D. Training costs are high. ->","completion":" B. Decentralized access control can result in less consistency because the individuals tasked with control may interpret policies and requirements differently and may perform their roles in different ways. Access outages, overly granular control, and training costs may occur, depending on specific implementations, but they are not commonly identified issues with decentralized access control.\n"}
{"prompt":"Callback to a landline phone number is an example of what type of factor? A. Something you know B. Somewhere you are C. Something you have D. Something you are ->","completion":" B. A callback to a landline phone number is an example of a \"somewhere you are\" factor because of the fixed physical location of a wired phone. A callback to a mobile phone would be a \"something you have\" factor.\n"}
{"prompt":"Kathleen needs to set up an Active Directory trust to allow authentication with an existing Kerberos K5 domain. What type of trust does she need to create? A. A shortcut trust B. A forest trust C. An external trust D. A realm trust ->","completion":" D. Kerberos uses realms, and the proper type of trust to set up for an Active Directory environment that needs to connect to a K5 domain is a realm trust. A shortcut trust is a transitive trust between parts of a domain tree or forest that shortens the trust path, a forest trust is a transitive trust between two forest root domains, and an external trust is a nontransitive trust between AD domains in separate forests.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following AAA protocols is the most commonly used? A. TACACS B. TACACS+ C. XTACACS D. Super TACACS ->","completion":" B. TACACS+ is the only modern protocol on the list. It provides advantages of both TACACS and XTACACS as well as some benefits over RADIUS, including encryption of all authentication information. Super TACACS is not an actual protocol.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not a single sign-on implementation? A. Kerberos B. ADFS C. CAS D. RADIUS ->","completion":" D. Kerberos, Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), and Central Authentication Services (CAS) are all SSO implementations. RADIUS is not a single sign-on implementation, although some vendors use it behind the scenes to provide authentication for proprietary SSO.\n"}
{"prompt":"As shown in the following image, a user on a Windows system is not able to use the \"Send Message\" functionality. What access control model best describes this type of limitation? A. Least privilege B. Need to know C. Constrained interface D. Separation of duties ->","completion":" C. Interface restrictions based on user privileges is an example of a constrained interface. Least privilege describes the idea of providing users with only the rights they need to accomplish their job, while need to know limits access based on whether a subject needs to know the information to accomplish an assigned task. Separation of duties focuses on preventing fraud or mistakes by splitting tasks between multiple subjects.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of access controls allow the owner of a file to grant other users access to it using an access control list? A. Role based B. Nondiscretionary C. Rule based D. Discretionary ->","completion":" D. When the owner of a file makes the decisions about who has rights or access privileges to it, they are using discretionary access control. Role-based access controls would grant access based on a subject's role, while rule-based controls would base the decision on a set of rules or requirements. Nondiscretionary access controls apply a fixed set of rules to an environment to manage access. Nondiscretionary access controls include rule-, role-, and lattice-based access controls.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex's job requires him to see protected health information (PHI) to ensure proper treatment of patients. His access to their medical records does not provide access to patient addresses or billing information. What access control concept best describes this control? A. Separation of duties B. Constrained interfaces C. Context-dependent control D. Need to know ->","completion":" D. Need to know is applied when subjects like Alex have access to only the data they need to accomplish their job. Separation of duties is used to limit fraud and abuse by having multiple employees perform parts of a task. Constrained interfaces restrict what a user can see or do and would be a reasonable answer if need to know did not describe his access more completely in this scenario. Context-dependent control relies on the activity being performed to apply controls, and this question does not specify a workflow or process.\n"}
{"prompt":"At point A in the diagram, the client sends the username and password to the KDC. How is the username and password protected? A. 3DES encryption B. TLS encryption C. SSL encryption D. AES encryption ->","completion":" D. The client in Kerberos logins uses AES to encrypt the username and password prior to sending it to the KDC.\n"}
{"prompt":"At point B in the diagram, what two important elements does the KDC send to the client after verifying that the username is valid? A. An encrypted TGT and a public key B. An access ticket and a public key C. An encrypted, time-stamped TGT and a symmetric key encrypted with a hash of the user's password D. An encrypted, time-stamped TGT and an access token ->","completion":" C. The KDC uses the user's password to generate a hash and then uses that hash to encrypt a symmetric key. It transmits both the encrypted symmetric key and an encrypted time-stamped TGT to the client.\n"}
{"prompt":"What tasks must the client perform before it can use the TGT? A. It must generate a hash of the TGT and decrypt the symmetric key. B. It must accept the TGT and decrypt the symmetric key. C. It must decrypt the TGT and the symmetric key. D. It must send a valid response using the symmetric key to the KDC and must install the TGT. ->","completion":" B. The client needs to install the TGT for use until it expires and must also decrypt the symmetric key using a hash of the user's password.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jacob is planning his organization's biometric authentication system and is considering retina scans. What concern may be raised about retina scans by others in his organization? A. Retina scans can reveal information about medical conditions. B. Retina scans are painful because they require a puff of air in the user's eye. C. Retina scanners are the most expensive type of biometric device. D. Retina scanners have a high false positive rate and will cause support issues. ->","completion":" A. Retina scans can reveal additional information, including high blood pressure and pregnancy, causing privacy concerns. Newer retina scans don't require a puff of air, and retina scanners are not the most expensive biometric factor. Their false positive rate can typically be adjusted in software, allowing administrators to adjust their acceptance rate as needed to balance usability and security.\n"}
{"prompt":"Mandatory Access Control is based on what type of model? A. Discretionary B. Group based C. Lattice based D. Rule based ->","completion":" C. Mandatory access control systems are based on a lattice-based model. Lattice-based models use a matrix of classification labels to compartmentalize data. Discretionary access models allow object owners to determine access to the objects they control, role-based access controls are often group based, and rule-based access controls like firewall ACLs apply rules to all subjects they apply to.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not a type of attack used against access controls? A. Dictionary attack B. Brute-force attack C. Teardrop D. Man-in-the-middle attack ->","completion":" C. Dictionary, brute-force, and man-in-the-middle attacks are all types of attacks that are frequently aimed at access controls. Teardrop attacks are a type of denial of service attack.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the best way to provide accountability for the use of identities? A. Logging B. Authorization C. Digital signatures D. Type 1 authentication ->","completion":" A. Logging systems can provide accountability for identity systems by tracking the actions, changes, and other activities a user or account performs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim has worked in human relations, payroll, and customer service roles in his company over the past few years. What type of process should his company perform to ensure that he has appropriate rights? A. Re-provisioning B. Account review C. Privilege creep D. Account revocation ->","completion":" B. As an employee's role changes, they often experience privilege creep, which is the accumulation of old rights and roles. Account review is the process of reviewing accounts and ensuring that their rights match their owners' role and job requirements. Account revocation removes accounts, while re-provisioning might occur if an employee was terminated and returned or took a leave of absence and returned.\n"}
{"prompt":"Biba is what type of access control model? A. MAC B. DAC C. Role BAC D. ABAC ->","completion":" A. Biba uses a lattice to control access and is a form of the mandatory access control (MAC) model. It does not use rules, roles, or attributes, nor does it allow user discretion. Users can create content at their level or lower but cannot decide who gets access, levels are not roles, and attributes are not used to make decisions on access control.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is a client\/server protocol designed to allow network access servers to authenticate remote users by sending access request messages to a central server? A. Kerberos B. EAP C. RADIUS D. OAuth ->","completion":" C. RADIUS is an AAA protocol used to provide authentication and authorization; it's often used for modems, wireless networks, and network devices. It uses network access servers to send access requests to central RADIUS servers. Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication protocol; OAuth is an open standard for authentication allowing the use of credentials from one site on third-party sites; and EAP is the Extensible Authentication Protocol, an authentication framework often used for wireless networks.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of access control is being used in the following permission listing: Storage Device X User1: Can read, write, list User2: Can read, list User3: Can read, write, list, delete User4: Can list A. Resource-based access controls B. Role-based access controls C. Mandatory access controls D. Rule-based access controls ->","completion":" A. Resource-based access controls match permissions to resources like a storage volume. Resource-based access controls are becoming increasingly common in cloud-based infrastructure as a service environments. The lack of roles, rules, or a classification system indicate that role-based, rule-based, and mandatory access controls are not in use here.\n"}
{"prompt":"Angela uses a sniffer to monitor traffic from a RADIUS server configured with default settings. What protocol should she monitor, and what traffic will she be able to read? A. UDP, none. All RADIUS traffic is encrypted. B. TCP, all traffic but the passwords, which are encrypted. C. UDP, all traffic but the passwords, which are encrypted. D. TCP, none. All RADIUS traffic is encrypted. ->","completion":" C. By default, RADIUS uses UDP and only encrypts passwords. RADIUS supports TCP and TLS, but this is not a default setting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not part of a Kerberos authentication system? A. KDC B. TGT C. AS D. TS ->","completion":" D. A key distribution center (KDC) provides authentication services, and ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) provide proof that a subject has authenticated and can request tickets to access objects. Authentication services (ASs) are part of the KDC. There is no TS in a Kerberos infrastructure.\n"}
{"prompt":"When an application or system allows a logged-in user to perform specific actions, it is an example of what? A. Roles B. Group management C. Logins D. Authorization ->","completion":" D. Authorization provides a user with capabilities or rights. Roles and group management are both methods that could be used to match users with rights. Logins are used to validate a user.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex has been employed by his company for more than a decade and has held a number of positions in the company. During an audit, it is discovered that he has access to shared folders and applications because of his former roles. What issue has Alex's company encountered? A. Excessive provisioning B. Unauthorized access C. Privilege creep D. Account review ->","completion":" C. Privilege creep occurs when users retain from roles they held previously rights they do not need to accomplish their current job. Unauthorized access occurs when an unauthorized user accesses files. Excessive provisioning is not a term used to describe permissions issues, and account review would help find issues like this.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not a common threat to access control mechanisms? A. Fake login pages B. Phishing C. Dictionary attacks D. Man-in-the-middle attacks ->","completion":" B. Phishing is not an attack against an access control mechanism. While phishing can result in stolen credentials, the attack itself is not against the control system and is instead against the person being phished. Dictionary attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks both target access control systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"What term properly describes what occurs when two or more processes require access to the same resource and must complete their tasks in the proper order for normal function? A. Collisions B. Race conditions C. Determinism D. Out-of-order execution ->","completion":" B. Race conditions occur when two or more processes need to access the same resource in the right order. If an attacker can disrupt this order, they may be able to affect the normal operations of the system and gain unauthorized access or improper rights. Collisions occur when two different files produce the same result from a hashing operation, out-of-order execution is a CPU architecture feature that allows the use of otherwise unused cycles, and determinism is a philosophical term rather than something you should see on the CISSP exam!\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of access control scheme is shown in the following table? Highly Sensitive Red Blue Green Confidential Purple Orange Yellow Internal Use Black Gray White Public Clear Clear Clear A. RBAC B. DAC C. MAC D. TBAC ->","completion":" C. Mandatory access controls use a lattice to describe how classification labels relate to each other. In this image, classification levels are set for each of the labels shown. A discretionary access control (DAC) system would show how the owner of the objects allows access. RBAC could be either rule- or role-based access control and would use either system-wide rules or roles. Task-based access control (TBAC) would list tasks for users.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not a valid LDAP DN (distinguished name)? A. cn=ben+ou=sales B. ou=example C. cn=ben,ou=example; D. ou=example,dc=example,dc=com+dc=org ->","completion":" C. LDAP distinguished names are made up of zero or more comma-separated components known as relative distinguished names. cn=ben,ou=example; ends with a semicolon and is not a valid DN. It is possible to have additional values in the same RDN by using a plus sign between then.\n"}
{"prompt":"When a subject claims an identity, what process is occurring? A. Login B. Identification C. Authorization D. Token presentation ->","completion":" B. The process of a subject claiming or professing an identity is known as identification. Authorization verifies the identity of a subject by checking a factor like a password. Logins typically include both identification and authorization, and token presentation is a type of authentication.\n"}
{"prompt":"Dogs, guards, and fences are all common examples of what type of control? A. Detective B. Recovery C. Administrative D. Physical ->","completion":" D. Dogs, guards, and fences are all examples of physical controls. While dogs and guards might detect a problem, fences cannot, so they are not all examples of detective controls. None of these controls would help repair or restore functionality after an issue, and thus they are not recovery controls, nor are they administrative controls that involve policy or procedures, although the guards might refer to them when performing their duties.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan's organization is updating its password policy and wants to use the strongest possible passwords. What password requirement will have the highest impact in preventing brute-force attacks? A. Change maximum age from 1 year to 180 days. B. Increase the minimum password length from 8 characters to 16 characters. C. Increase the password complexity so that at least three character classes (such as uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) are required. D. Retain a password history of at least four passwords to prevent reuse. ->","completion":" B. Password complexity is driven by length, and a longer password will be more effective against brute-force attacks than a shorter password. Each character of additional length increases the difficulty by the size of the potential character set (for example, a single lowercase character makes the passwords 26 times more difficult to crack). While each of the other settings is useful for a strong password policy, they won't have the same impact on brute-force attacks.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the stored sample of a biometric factor called? A. A reference template B. A token store C. A biometric password D. An enrollment artifact ->","completion":" A. The stored sample of a biometric factor is called a reference profile or a reference template. None of the other answers is a common term used for biometric systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"When might an organization using biometrics choose to allow a higher FRR instead of a higher FAR? A. When security is more important than usability B. When false rejection is not a concern due to data quality C. When the CER of the system is not known D. When the CER of the system is very high ->","completion":" A. Organizations that have very strict security requirements that don't have a tolerance for false acceptance want to lower the false acceptance rate, or FAR, to be as near to zero as possible. That often means that the false rejection rate, or FRR, increases. Different biometric technologies or a better registration method can help improve biometric performance, but false rejections due to data quality are not typically a concern with modern biometric systems. In this case, knowing the crossover error rate, or CER, or having a very high CER doesn't help the decision.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan is working to improve the strength of her organization's passwords by changing the password policy. The password system that she is using allows uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers but no other characters. How much additional complexity does adding a single character to the minimum length of passwords for her organization create? A. 26 times more complex B. 62 times more complex C. 36 times more complex D. 2^62 times more complex ->","completion":" B. The complexity of brute-forcing a password increases based on both the number of potential characters and the number of letters added. In this case, there are 26 lowercase letters, 26 uppercase letters, and 10 possible digits. That creates 62 possibilities. Since we added only a single letter of length, we get 62^1, or 62 possibilities, and thus, the new passwords would be 62 times harder to brute-force on average.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which pair of the following factors is key for user acceptance of biometric identification systems? A. The FAR B. The throughput rate and the time required to enroll C. The CER and the ERR D. How often users must reenroll and the reference profile requirements ->","completion":" B. Biometric systems can face major usability challenges if the time to enroll is long (over a couple of minutes) and if the speed at which the biometric system is able to scan and accept or reject the user is too slow. FAR and FRR may be important in the design decisions made by administrators or designers, but they aren't typically visible to users. CER and ERR are the same and are the point where FAR and FRR meet. Reference profile requirements are a system requirement, not a user requirement.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex is concerned about eavesdropping on the SAML traffic and also wants to ensure that forged assertions will not be successful. What should he do to prevent these potential attacks? A. Use SAML's secure mode to provide secure authentication. B. Implement TLS using a strong cipher suite, which will protect against both types of attacks. C. Implement TLS using a strong cipher suite and use digital signatures. D. Implement TLS using a strong cipher suite and message hashing. ->","completion":" C. TLS provides message confidentiality and integrity, which can prevent eavesdropping. When paired with digital signatures, which provide integrity and authentication, forged assertions can also be defeated. SAML does not have a security mode and relies on TLS and digital signatures to ensure security if needed. Message hashing without a signature would help prevent modification of the message but won't necessarily provide authentication.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Alex's organization is one that is primarily made up of offsite, traveling users, what availability risk does integration of critical business applications to onsite authentication create, and how could he solve it? A. Third-party integration may not be trustworthy; use SSL and digital signatures. B. If the home organization is offline, traveling users won't be able to access third-party applications; implement a hybrid cloud\/local authentication system. C. Local users may not be properly redirected to the third-party services; implement a local gateway. D. Browsers may not properly redirect; use host files to ensure that issues with redirects are resolved. ->","completion":" B. Integration with cloud-based third parties that rely on local authentication can fail if the local organization's Internet connectivity or servers are offline. Adopting a hybrid cloud and local authentication system can ensure that Internet or server outages are handled, allowing authentication to work regardless of where the user is or if their home organization is online. Using encrypted and signed communication does not address availability, redirects are a configuration issue with the third party, and a local gateway won't handle remote users. Also, host files don't help with availability issues with services other than DNS.\n"}
{"prompt":"What solution can best help address concerns about third parties that control SSO redirects as shown in step 2 in the diagram? A. An awareness campaign about trusted third parties B. TLS C. Handling redirects at the local site D. Implementing an IPS to capture SSO redirect attacks ->","completion":" A. While many solutions are technical, if a trusted third party redirects to an unexpected authentication site, awareness is often the best defense. Using TLS would keep the transaction confidential but would not prevent the redirect. Handling redirects locally only works for locally hosted sites, and using a third-party service requires offsite redirects. An IPS might detect an attacker's redirect, but tracking the multitude of load-balanced servers most large providers use can be challenging, if not impossible. In addition, an IPS relies on visibility into the traffic, and SAML integrations should be encrypted for security, which would require a man-in-the-middle type of IPS to be configured.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan has been asked to recommend whether her organization should use a MAC scheme or a DAC scheme. If flexibility and scalability are important requirements for implementing access controls, which scheme should she recommend and why? A. MAC, because it provides greater scalability and flexibility because you can simply add more labels as needed B. DAC, because allowing individual administrators to make choices about the objects they control provides scalability and flexibility C. MAC, because compartmentalization is well suited to flexibility and adding compartments will allow it to scale well D. DAC, because a central decision process allows quick responses and will provide scalability by reducing the number of decisions required and flexibility by moving those decisions to a central authority ->","completion":" B. Discretionary access control (DAC) can provide greater scalability by leveraging many administrators, and those administrators can add flexibility by making decisions about access to their objects without fitting into an inflexible mandatory access control system (MAC). MAC is more secure due to the strong set of controls it provides, but it does not scale as well as DAC and is relatively inflexible in comparison.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following tools is not typically used to verify that a provisioning process was followed in a way that ensures that the organization's security policy is being followed? A. Log review B. Manual review of permissions C. Signature-based detection D. Review the audit trail ->","completion":" C. While signature-based detection is used to detect attacks, review of provisioning processes typically involves checking logs, reviewing the audit trail, or performing a manual review of permissions granted during the provisioning process.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren needs to send information about services she is provisioning to a third-party organization. What standards-based markup language should she choose to build the interface? A. SAML B. SOAP C. SPML D. XACML ->","completion":" C. Service Provisioning Markup Language, or SPML, is an XML-based language designed to allow platforms to generate and respond to provisioning requests. SAML is used to make authorization and authentication data, while XACML is used to describe access controls. SOAP, or Simple Object Access Protocol, is a messaging protocol and could be used for any XML messaging but is not a markup language itself.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a penetration test, Chris recovers a file containing hashed passwords for the system he is attempting to access. What type of attack is most likely to succeed against the hashed passwords? A. A brute-force attack B. A pass-the-hash attack C. A rainbow table attack D. A salt recovery attack ->","completion":" C. Rainbow tables are databases of prehashed passwords paired with high-speed lookup functions. Since they can quickly compare known hashes against those in a file, using rainbow tables is the fastest way to quickly determine passwords from hashes. A bruteforce attack may eventually succeed but will be very slow against most hashes. Pass-thehash attacks rely on sniffed or otherwise acquired NTLM or LanMan hashes being sent to a system to avoid the need to know a user's password. Salts are data added to a hash to avoid the use of tools like rainbow tables. A salt added to a password means the hash won't match a rainbow table generated without the same salt.\n"}
{"prompt":"Google's identity integration with a variety of organizations and applications across domains is an example of which of the following? A. PKI B. Federation C. Single sign-on D. Provisioning ->","completion":" B. Google's federation with other applications and organizations allows single sign-on as well as management of their electronic identity and its related attributes. While this is an example of SSO, it goes beyond simple single sign-on. Provisioning provides accounts and rights, and a public key infrastructure is used for certificate management.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren starts at her new job and finds that she has access to a variety of systems that she does not need to accomplish her job. What problem has she encountered? A. Privilege creep B. Rights collision C. Least privilege D. Excessive privileges ->","completion":" D. When users have more rights than they need to accomplish their job, they have excessive privileges. This is a violation of the concept of least privilege. Unlike creeping privileges, this is a provisioning or rights management issue rather than a problem of retention of rights the user needed but no longer requires. Rights collision is a made-up term and thus is not an issue here.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Chris verifies an individual's identity and adds a unique identifier like a user ID to an identity system, what process has occurred? A. Identity proofing B. Registration C. Directory management D. Session management ->","completion":" B. Registration is the process of adding a user to an identity management system. This includes creating their unique identifier and adding any attribute information that is associated with their identity. Proofing occurs when the user provides information to prove who they are. Directories are managed to maintain lists of users, services, and other items. Session management tracks application and user sessions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim configures his LDAP client to connect to an LDAP directory server. According to the configuration guide, his client should connect to the server on port 636. What does this indicate to Jim about the configuration of the LDAP server? A. It requires connections over SSL\/TLS. B. It supports only unencrypted connections. C. It provides global catalog services. D. It does not provide global catalog services. ->","completion":" A. Port 636 is the default port for LDAP-S, which provides LDAP over SSL or TLS, thus indicating that the server supports encrypted connections. Since neither port 3268 nor 3269 is mentioned, we do not know if the server provides support for a global catalog.\n"}
{"prompt":"The X.500 standards cover what type of important identity systems? A. Kerberos B. Provisioning services C. Biometric authentication systems D. Directory services ->","completion":" D. The X.500 series of standards covers directory services. Kerberos is described in RFCs; biometric systems are covered by a variety of standards, including ISO standards; and provisioning standards include SCIM, SPML, and others.\n"}
{"prompt":"Microsoft's Active Directory Domain Services is based on which of the following technologies? A. RADIUS B. LDAP C. SSO D. PKI ->","completion":" B. Active Directory Domain Services is based on LDAP, the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. Active Directory also uses Kerberos for authentication.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren is responsible for building a banking website. She needs proof of the identity of the users who register for the site. How should she validate user identities? A. Require users to create unique questions that only they will know. B. Require new users to bring their driver's license or passport in person to the bank. C. Use information that both the bank and the user have such as questions pulled from their credit report. D. Call the user on their registered phone number to verify that they are who they claim to be. ->","completion":" C. Identity proofing can be done by comparing user information that the organization already has, like account numbers or personal information. Requiring users to create unique questions can help with future support by providing a way for them to do password resets. Using a phone call only verifies that the individual who created the account has the phone that they registered and won't prove their identity. In-person verification would not fit the business needs of most websites.\n"}
{"prompt":"By default, in what format does OpenLDAP store the value of the userPassword attribute? A. In the clear B. Salted and hashed C. MD5 hashed D. Encrypted using AES256 encryption ->","completion":" A. By default, OpenLDAP stores the userPassword attribute in the clear. This means that ensuring that the password is provided to OpenLDAP in a secure format is the responsibility of the administrator or programmer who builds its provisioning system.\n"}
{"prompt":"A new customer at a bank that uses fingerprint scanners to authenticate its users is surprised when he scans his fingerprint and is logged in to another customer's account. What type of biometric factor error occurred? A. A registration error B. A Type 1 error C. A Type 2 error D. A time of use, method of use error ->","completion":" C. Type 2 errors occur in biometric systems when an invalid subject is incorrectly authenticated as a valid user. In this case, nobody except the actual customer should be validated when fingerprints are scanned. Type 1 errors occur when a valid subject is not authenticated; if the existing customer was rejected, it would be a Type 1 error. Registration is the process of adding users, but registration errors and time of use, method of use errors are not specific biometric authentication terms.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of access control is typically used by firewalls? A. Discretionary access controls B. Rule-based access controls C. Task-based access control D. Mandatory access controls ->","completion":" B. Firewalls use rule-based access control, or Rule-BAC, in their access control lists and apply rules created by administrators to all traffic that pass through them. DAC, or discretionary access control, allows owners to determine who can access objects they control, while task-based access control lists tasks for users. MAC, or mandatory access control, uses classifications to determine access.\n"}
{"prompt":"When you input a user ID and password, you are performing what important identity and access management activity? A. Authorization B. Validation C. Authentication D. Login ->","completion":" C. When you input a username and password, you are authenticating yourself by providing a unique identifier and a verification that you are the person who should have that identifier (the password). Authorization is the process of determining what a user is allowed to do. Validation and login both describe elements of what is happening in the process; however, they aren't the most important identity and access management activity.\n"}
{"prompt":"Kathleen works for a data center hosting facility that provides physical data center space for individuals and organizations. Until recently, each client was given a magnetic-stripbased keycard to access the section of the facility where their servers are located, and they were also given a key to access the cage or rack where their servers reside. In the past month, a number of servers have been stolen, but the logs for the passcards show only valid IDs. What is Kathleen's best option to make sure that the users of the passcards are who they are supposed to be? A. Add a reader that requires a PIN for passcard users. B. Add a camera system to the facility to observe who is accessing servers. C. Add a biometric factor. D. Replace the magnetic stripe keycards with smartcards. ->","completion":" C. Kathleen should implement a biometric factor. The cards and keys are an example of a Type 2 factor, or \"something you have.\" Using a smart card replaces this with another Type 2 factor, but the cards could still be loaned out or stolen. Adding a PIN suffers from the same problem: a PIN can be stolen. Adding cameras doesn't prevent access to the facility and thus doesn't solve the immediate problem (but it is a good idea!).\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is a ticket-based authentication protocol designed to provide secure communication? A. RADIUS B. OAuth C. SAML D. Kerberos ->","completion":" D. Kerberos is an authentication protocol that uses tickets and provides secure communications between the client, key distribution center (KDC), ticket-granting service (TGS), authentication server (AS), and endpoint services. RADIUS does not provide the same level of security by default, SAML is a markup language, and OAuth is designed to allow third-party websites to rely on credentials from other sites like Google or Microsoft.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of access control is composed of policies and procedures that support regulations, requirements, and the organization's own policies? A. Corrective B. Logical C. Compensating D. Administrative ->","completion":" D. Administrative access controls are procedures and the policies from which they derive. They are based on regulations, requirements, and the organization's own policies. Corrective access controls return an environment to its original status after an issue, while logical controls are technical access controls that rely on hardware or software to protect systems and data. Compensating controls are used in addition to or as an alternative to other controls.\n"}
{"prompt":"In a Kerberos environment, when a user needs to access a network resource, what is sent to the TGS? A. A TGT B. An AS C. The SS D. A session key ->","completion":" A. When clients perform a client service authorization, they send a TGT and the ID of the requested service to the TGS, and the TGS responds with a client-to-server ticket and session key back to the client if the request is validated. An AS is an authentication server, and the SS is a service server, neither of which can be sent.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which objects and subjects have a label in a MAC model? A. Objects and subjects that are classified as Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret have a label. B. All objects have a label, and all subjects have a compartment. C. All objects and subjects have a label. D. All subjects have a label and all objects have a compartment. ->","completion":" C. In a mandatory access control system, all subjects and objects have a label. Compartments may or may not be used, but there is not a specific requirement for either subjects or objects to be compartmentalized. The specific labels of Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret are not required by MAC.\n"}
{"prompt":"When the e-commerce application creates an account for a Google user, where should that user's password be stored? A. The password is stored in the e-commerce application's database. B. The password is stored in memory on the e-commerce application's server. C. The password is stored in Google's account management system. D. The password is never stored; instead, a salted hash is stored in Google's account management system. ->","completion":" D. Passwords are never stored for web applications in a well-designed environment. Instead, salted hashes are stored and compared to passwords after they are salted and hashed. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which system or systems is\/are responsible for user authentication for Google users? A. The e-commerce application. B. Both the e-commerce application and Google servers. C. Google servers. D. The diagram does not provide enough information to determine this. ->","completion":" C. When a third-party site integrates via OAuth 2.0, authentication is handled by the service provider's servers. In this case, Google is acting as the service provider for user authentication. Authentication for local users who create their own accounts would occur in the e-commerce application (or a related server), but that is not the question that is asked here.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of attack is the creation and exchange of state tokens intended to prevent? A. XSS B. CSRF C. SQL injection D. XACML ->","completion":" B. The anti-forgery state token exchanged during OAuth sessions is intended to prevent cross-site request forgery. This makes sure that the unique session token with the authentication response from Google's OAuth service is available to verify that the user, not an attacker, is making a request. XSS attacks focus on scripting and would have script tags involved, SQL injection would have SQL code included, and XACML is the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language, not a type of attack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Questions like \"What is your pet's name?\" are examples of what type of identity proofing? A. Knowledge-based authentication B. Dynamic knowledge-based authentication C. Out-of-band identity proofing D. A Type 3 authentication factor ->","completion":" A. Knowledge-based authentication relies on preset questions such as \"What is your pet's name?\" and the answers. It can be susceptible to attacks because of the availability of the answers on social media or other sites. Dynamic knowledge-based authentication relies on facts or data that the user already knows that can be used to create questions they can answer on an as-needed basis (for example, a previous address, or a school they attended). Out-of-band identity proofing relies on an alternate channel like a phone call or text message. Finally, Type 3 authentication factors are biometric, or \"something you are,\" rather than knowledge based.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren builds a table that includes assigned privileges, objects, and subjects to manage access control for the systems she is responsible for. Each time a subject attempts to access an object, the systems check the table to ensure that the subject has the appropriate rights to the objects. What type of access control system is Lauren using? A. A capability table B. An access control list C. An access control matrix D. A subject\/object rights management system ->","completion":" C. An access control matrix is a table that lists objects, subjects, and their privileges. Access control lists focus on objects and which subjects can access them. Capability tables list subjects and what objects they can access. Subject\/object rights management systems are not based on an access control model.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a review of support incidents, Ben's organization discovered that password changes accounted for more than a quarter of its help desk's cases. Which of the following options would be most likely to decrease that number significantly? A. Two-factor authentication B. Biometric authentication C. Self-service password reset D. Passphrases ->","completion":" C. Self-service password reset tools typically have a significant impact on the number of password reset contacts that a help desk has. Two-factor and biometric authentication both add additional complexity and may actually increase the number of contacts. Passphrases can be easier to remember than traditional complex passwords and may decrease calls, but they don't have the same impact that a self-service system does.\n"}
{"prompt":"Brian's large organization has used RADIUS for AAA services for its network devices for years and has recently become aware of security issues with the unencrypted information transferred during authentication. How should Brian implement encryption for RADIUS? A. Use the built-in encryption in RADIUS. B. Implement RADIUS over its native UDP using TLS for protection. C. Implement RADIUS over TCP using TLS for protection. D. Use an AES256 pre-shared cipher between devices. ->","completion":" C. RADIUS supports TLS over TCP. RADIUS does not have a supported TLS mode over UDP. AES pre-shared symmetric ciphers are not a supported solution and would be very difficult to both implement and maintain in a large environment, and the built-in encryption in RADIUS only protects passwords.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim wants to allow cloud-based applications to act on his behalf to access information from other sites. Which of the following tools can allow that? A. Kerberos B. OAuth C. OpenID D. LDAP ->","completion":" B. OAuth provides the ability to access resources from another service and would meet Jim's needs. OpenID would allow him to use an account from another service with his application, and Kerberos and LDAP are used more frequently for in-house services.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben's organization has had an issue with unauthorized access to applications and workstations during the lunch hour when employees aren't at their desk. What are the best types of session management solutions for Ben to recommend to help prevent this type of access? A. Use session IDs for all access and verify system IP addresses of all workstations. B. Set session time-outs for applications and use password-protected screensavers with inactivity time-outs on workstations. C. Use session IDs for all applications, and use password protected screensavers with inactivity time-outs on workstations. D. Set session time-outs for applications and verify system IP addresses of all workstations. ->","completion":" B. Since physical access to the workstations is part of the problem, setting application time-outs and password-protected screensavers with relatively short inactivity time-outs can help prevent unauthorized access. Using session IDs for all applications and verifying system IP addresses would be helpful for online attacks against applications.\n"}
{"prompt":"Match each of the numbered security controls listed with exactly one of the lettered categories shown. Choose the category that best describes each control. You may use each control category once, more than once, or not at all. Controls Password Account reviews Badge readers MFA IDP Categories A. Administrative B. Technical C. Physical ->","completion":" The security controls match with the categories as follows: Password: B. Technical. Account reviews: A. Administrative. Badge readers: C. Physical. MFA: B. Technical. IDP: B. Technical. Passwords, multifactor authentication (MFA) techniques, and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are all examples of technical controls. Account reviews are an administrative control, while using badges to control access is a physical control.\n"}
{"prompt":"The financial services company that Susan works for provides a web portal for its users. When users need to verify their identity, the company uses information from third-party sources to ask questions based on their past credit reports, such as \"Which of the following streets did you live on in 2007?\" What process is Susan's organization using? A. Identity proofing B. Password verification C. Authenticating with Type 2 authentication factor D. Out-of-band identity proofing ->","completion":" A. Verifying information that an individual should know about themselves using thirdparty factual information (a Type 1 authentication factor) is sometimes known as dynamic knowledge-based authentication and is a type of identity proofing. Out-of-band identity proofing would use another means of contacting the user, like a text message or phone call, and password verification requires a password.\n"}
{"prompt":"The United States (U.S.) government CAC is an example of what form of Type 2 authentication factor? A. A token B. A biometric identifier C. A smart card D. A PIV ->","completion":" C. The US government's Common Access Card is a smart card. The US government also issues PIV cards, or personal identity verification cards.\n"}
{"prompt":"What authentication technology can be paired with OAuth to perform identity verification and obtain user profile information using a RESTful API? A. SAML B. Shibboleth C. OpenID Connect D. Higgins ->","completion":" C. OpenID Connect is a RESTful, JSON-based authentication protocol that, when paired with OAuth, can provide identity verification and basic profile information. SAML is the Security Assertion Markup Language, Shibboleth is a federated identity solution designed to allow web-based SSO, and Higgins is an open-source project designed to provide users with control over the release of their identity information.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim has Secret clearance and is accessing files that use a mandatory access control scheme to apply the Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, and Unclassified label scheme. What classification levels of data can he access, provided that he has a valid need-to-know? A. Top Secret and Secret B. Secret, Confidential, and Unclassified C. Secret data only D. Secret and Unclassified ->","completion":" C. In a mandatory access control system, classifications do not have to include rights to lower levels. This means that the only label we can be sure Jim has rights to is Secret. Despite that it is unclassified, Unclassified data remains a different label, and Jim may not be authorized to access it.\n"}
{"prompt":"The security administrators at the company that Susan works for have configured the workstation she uses to allow her to log in only during her work hours. What type of access control best describes this limitation? A. Constrained interface B. Context-dependent control C. Content-dependent control D. Least privilege ->","completion":" B. Time-based controls are an example of context-dependent controls. A constrained interface would limit what Susan was able to do in an application or system interface, while content-dependent control would limit her access to content based on her role or rights. Least privilege is used to ensure that subjects only receive the rights they need to perform their role.\n"}
{"prompt":"Match each of the numbered authentication techniques with the appropriate lettered category. Each technique should be matched with exactly one category. Each category may be used once, more than once, or not at all. Authentication technique Password ID card Retinal scan Smartphone token Fingerprint analysis Category A. Something you have B. Something you know C. Something you are ->","completion":" The security controls match with the categories as follows: Password: B. Something you know. ID card: A. Something you have. Retinal scan: C. Something you are. Smartphone token: A. Something you have. Fingerprint analysis: C. Something you are.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not an access control layer? A. Physical B. Policy C. Administrative D. Technical ->","completion":" B. Policy is a subset of the administrative layer of access controls. Administrative, technical, and physical access controls all play an important role in security.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben uses a software-based token that changes its code every minute. What type of token is he using? A. Asynchronous B. Smart card C. Synchronous D. Static ->","completion":" C. Synchronous soft tokens, such as Google Authenticator, use a time-based algorithm that generates a constantly changing series of codes. Asynchronous tokens typically require a challenge to be entered on the token to allow it to calculate a response, which the server compares to the response it expects. Smartcards typically present a certificate but may have other token capabilities built in. Static tokens are physical devices that can contain credentials and include smart cards and memory cards.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of token-based authentication system uses a challenge\/response process in which the challenge has to be entered on the token? A. Asynchronous B. Smart card C. Synchronous D. RFID ->","completion":" A. Asynchronous tokens use a challenge\/response process in which the system sends a challenge and the user responds with a PIN and a calculated response to the challenge. The server performs the same calculations, and if both match, it authenticates the user. Synchronous tokens use a time-based calculation to generate codes. Smart cards are paired with readers and don't need to have challenges entered, and RFID devices are not used for challenge\/response tokens.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben's company is considering configuring its systems to work at the level shown by point A on the diagram. To what level is it setting the sensitivity? A. The FRR crossover B. The FAR point C. The CER D. The CFR ->","completion":" C. The crossover error rate is the point where false acceptance rate and false rejection rate cross over and is a standard assessment used to compare the accuracy of biometric devices.\n"}
{"prompt":"At point B, what problem is likely to occur? A. False acceptance will be very high. B. False rejection will be very high. C. False rejection will be very low. D. False acceptance will be very low. ->","completion":" A. At point B, the false acceptance rate, or FAR, is quite high, while the false rejection rate, or FRR, is relatively low. This may be acceptable in some circumstances, but in organizations where a false acceptance can cause a major problem, it is likely that they should instead choose a point to the right of point A.\n"}
{"prompt":"What should Ben do if the FAR and FRR shown in this diagram does not provide an acceptable performance level for his organization's needs? A. Adjust the sensitivity of the biometric devices. B. Assess other biometric systems to compare them. C. Move the CER. D. Adjust the FRR settings in software. ->","completion":" B. CER is a standard used to assess biometric devices. If the CER for this device does not fit the needs of the organization, Ben should assess other biometric systems to find one with a lower CER. Sensitivity is already accounted for in CER charts, and moving the CER isn't something Ben can do. FRR is not a setting in software, so Ben can't use that as an option either.\n"}
{"prompt":"What LDAP authentication mode can provide secure authentication? A. Anonymous B. SASL C. Simple D. S-LDAP ->","completion":" B. The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) for LDAP provides support for a range of authentication types, including secure methods. Anonymous authentication does not require or provide security, and simple authentication can be tunneled over SSL or TLS but does not provide security by itself. S-LDAP is not an LDAP protocol.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following Type 3 authenticators is appropriate to use by itself rather than in combination with other biometric factors? A. Voice pattern recognition B. Hand geometry C. Palm scans D. Heart\/pulse patterns ->","completion":" C. Palm scans compare the vein patterns in the palm to a database to authenticate a user. Vein patterns are unique, and this method is a better single-factor authentication method than voice pattern recognition, hand geometry, and pulse patterns, each of which can be more difficult to uniquely identify between individuals or can be fooled more easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"What danger is created by allowing the OpenID relying party to control the connection to the OpenID provider? A. It may cause incorrect selection of the proper OpenID provider. B. It creates the possibility of a phishing attack by sending data to a fake OpenID provider. C. The relying party may be able to steal the client's username and password. D. The relying party may not send a signed assertion. ->","completion":" B. Allowing the relying party to provide the redirect to the OpenID provider could allow a phishing attack by directing clients to a fake OpenID provider that can capture valid credentials. Since the OpenID provider URL is provided by the client, the relying party cannot select the wrong provider. The relying party never receives the user's password, which means that they can't steal it. Finally, the relying party receives the signed assertion but does not send one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim is implementing a cloud identity solution for his organization. What type of technology is he putting in place? A. Identity as a service B. Employee ID as a service C. Cloud-based RADIUS D. OAuth ->","completion":" A. IDaaS, or identity as a service, provides an identity platform as a third-party service. This can provide benefits including integration with cloud services and removing overhead for maintenance of traditional on-premises identity systems, but it can also create risk due to third-party control of identity services and reliance on an offsite identity infrastructure.\n"}
{"prompt":"RAID-5 is an example of what type of control? A. Administrative B. Recovery C. Compensation D. Logical ->","completion":" B. Drives in a RAID-5 array are intended to handle failure of a drive. This is an example of a recovery control, which is used to return operations to normal function after a failure. Administrative controls are policies and procedures. Compensation controls help cover for issues with primary controls or improve them. Logical controls are software and hardware mechanisms used to protect resources and systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Alex sets the permissions shown in the following image as one of many users on a Linux server, what type of access control model is he leveraging? A. Role Based Access Control B. Rule-based Access control C. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) D. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) ->","completion":" D. The Linux filesystem allows the owners of objects to determine the access rights that subjects have to them. This means that it is a discretionary access control. If the system enforced a role-based access control, Alex wouldn't set the controls; they would be set based on the roles assigned to each subject. A rule-based access control system would apply rules throughout the system, and a mandatory access control system uses classification labels.\n"}
{"prompt":"What open protocol was designed to replace RADIUS鈥攊ncluding support for additional commands and protocols, replacing UDP traffic with TCP, and providing for extensible commands鈥攂ut does not preserve backward compatibility with RADIUS? A. TACACS B. RADIUS-NG C. Kerberos D. Diameter ->","completion":" D. Diameter was designed to provide enhanced, modern features to replace RADIUS. Diameter provides better reliability and a broad range of improved functionality. RADIUS-NG does not exist, Kerberos is not a direct competitor for RADIUS, and TACACS is not an open protocol.\n"}
{"prompt":"LDAP distinguished names (DNs) are made up of comma-separated components called relative distinguished names (RDNs) that have an attribute name and a value. DNs become less specific as they progress from left to right. Which of the following LDAP DNs best fits this rule? A. uid=ben,ou=sales,dc=example,dc=com B. uid=ben,dc=com,dc=example C. dc=com,dc=example,ou=sales,uid=ben D. ou=sales,dc=com,dc=example ->","completion":" A. In this example, uid=ben,ou=sales,dc=example,dc=com, the items proceed from most specific to least specific (broadest) from left to right, as required by a DN.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan is troubleshooting Kerberos authentication problems with symptoms including TGTs that are not accepted as valid and an inability to receive new tickets. If the system she is troubleshooting is properly configured for Kerberos authentication, her username and password are correct, and her network connection is functioning, what is the most likely issue? A. The Kerberos server is offline. B. There is a protocol mismatch. C. The client's TGTs have been marked as compromised and de-authorized. D. The Kerberos server and the local client's time clocks are not synchronized. ->","completion":" D. Kerberos relies on properly synchronized time on each end of a connection to function. If the local system time is more than five minutes out of sync, valid TGTs will be invalid and the system won't receive any new tickets.\n"}
{"prompt":"Kerberos, KryptoKnight, and SESAME are all examples of what type of system? A. SSO B. PKI C. CMS D. Directory ->","completion":" A. Kerberos, KryptoKnight, and SESAME are all single sign-on, or SSO, systems. PKI systems are public key infrastructure systems, CMS systems are content management systems, and LDAP and other directory servers provide information about services, resources, and individuals.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following access control categories would not include a door lock? A. Physical B. Directive C. Preventative D. Deterrent ->","completion":" B. Locks can be preventative access controls by stopping unwanted access, can deter potential intruders by making access difficult, and are physical access controls. They are not directive controls because they don't control the actions of subjects.\n"}
{"prompt":"What authentication protocol does Windows use by default for Active Directory systems? A. RADIUS B. Kerberos C. OAuth D. TACACS+ ->","completion":" B. Windows uses Kerberos for authentication. RADIUS is typically used for wireless networks, modems, and network devices, while OAuth is primarily used for web applications. TACACS+ is used for network devices.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex configures his LDAP server to provide services on 636 and 3269. What type of LDAP services has he configured based on LDAP's default ports? A. Unsecure LDAP and unsecure global directory B. Unsecure LDAP and secure global directory C. Secure LDAP and secure global directory D. Secure LDAP and unsecure global directory ->","completion":" C. The default ports for SSL\/TLS LDAP directory information and global catalog services are 636 and 3269, respectively. Unsecure LDAP uses 389, and unsecure global directory services use 3268.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a port scan, Susan discovers a system running services on TCP and UDP 137-139 and TCP 445, as well as TCP 1433. What type of system is she likely to find if she connects to the machine? A. A Linux email server B. A Windows SQL server C. A Linux file server D. A Windows workstation ->","completion":" B. TCP and UDP ports 137-139 are used for NetBIOS services, whereas 445 is used for Active Directory. TCP 1433 is the default port for Microsoft SQL, indicating that this is probably a Windows server providing SQL services.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is a method used to design new software tests and to ensure the quality of tests? A. Code auditing B. Static code analysis C. Regression testing D. Mutation testing ->","completion":" D. Mutation testing modifies a program in small ways and then tests that mutant to determine if it behaves as it should or if it fails. This technique is used to design and test software tests through mutation. Static code analysis and regression testing are both means of testing code, whereas code auditing is an analysis of source code rather than a means of designing and testing software tests.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a port scan, Lauren found TCP port 443 open on a system. Which tool is best suited to scanning the service that is most likely running on that port? A. zzuf B. Nikto C. Metasploit D. sqlmap ->","completion":" B. TCP port 443 normally indicates an HTTPS server. Nikto is useful for vulnerability scanning web servers and applications and is the best choice listed for a web server. Metasploit includes some scanning functionality but is not a purpose-built tool for vulnerability scanning. zzuf is a fuzzing tool and isn't relevant for vulnerability scans, whereas sqlmap is a SQL injection testing tool.\n"}
{"prompt":"What message logging standard is commonly used by network devices, Linux and Unix systems, and many other enterprise devices? A. Syslog B. Netlog C. Eventlog D. Remote Log Protocol (RLP) ->","completion":" A. Syslog is a widely used protocol for event and message logging. Eventlog, netlog, and Remote Log Protocol are all made-up terms.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex wants to use an automated tool to fill web application forms to test for format string vulnerabilities. What type of tool should he use? A. A black box B. A brute-force tool C. A fuzzer D. A static analysis tool ->","completion":" C. Fuzzers are tools that are designed to provide invalid or unexpected input to applications, testing for vulnerabilities like format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflow issues, and other problems. A static analysis relies on examining code without running the application or code and thus would not fill forms as part of a web application. Bruteforce tools attempt to bypass security by trying every possible combination for passwords or other values. A black box is a type of penetration test where the testers do not know anything about the environment.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan needs to scan a system for vulnerabilities, and she wants to use an open-source tool to test the system remotely. Which of the following tools will meet her requirements and allow vulnerability scanning? A. Nmap B. OpenVAS C. MBSA D. Nessus ->","completion":" B. OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanning tool that will provide Susan with a report of the vulnerabilities that it can identify from a remote, network-based scan. Nmap is an open-source port scanner. Both the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and Nessus are closed-source tools, although Nessus was originally open source.\n"}
{"prompt":"NIST Special Publication 800-53A describes four major types of assessment objects that can be used to identify items being assessed. If the assessment covers IPS devices, which type of assessment objects is being assessed? A. A specification B. A mechanism C. An activity D. An individual ->","completion":" B. An IPS is an example of a mechanism like a hardware-, software-, or firmware-based control or system. Specifications are document-based artifacts like policies or designs, activities are actions that support an information system that involves people, and an individual is one or more people applying specifications, mechanisms, or activities.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim has been contracted to perform a penetration test of a bank's primary branch. In order to make the test as real as possible, he has not been given any information about the bank other than its name and address. What type of penetration test has Jim agreed to perform? A. A crystal box penetration test B. A gray box penetration test C. A black box penetration test D. A white box penetration test ->","completion":" C. Jim has agreed to a black box penetration test, which provides no information about the organization, its systems, or its defenses. A crystal or white box penetration test provides all of the information an attacker needs, whereas a gray box penetration test provides some, but not all, information.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex is using nmap to perform port scanning of a system, and he receives three different port status messages in the results. Match each of the numbered status messages with the appropriate lettered description. You should use each item exactly once. Status message Open Closed Filtered Description A. The port is accessible on the remote system, but no application is accepting connections on that port. B. The port is not accessible on the remote system. C. The port is accessible on the remote system, and an application is accepting connections on that port. ->","completion":" The status messages match with the descriptions as follows: Open: C. The port is accessible on the remote system and an application is accepting connections on that port. Closed: A. The port is accessible on the remote system, but no application is accepting connections on that port. Filtered: B. The port is not accessible on the remote system.\n"}
{"prompt":"In a response to a Request for Proposal, Susan receives an SSAE 18 SOC 1 report. If she wants a report that includes operating effectiveness detail, what should Susan ask for as follow-up and why? A. A SOC 2 Type II report, because Type I does not cover operating effectiveness B. A SOC 1 Type I report, because SOC 2 does not cover operating effectiveness C. A SOC 2 Type I report, because SOC 2 Type II does not cover operating effectiveness D. A SOC 3 report, because SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports are outdated ->","completion":" C. Service Organization Control (SOC) reports replaced SAS-70 reports in 2010. A Type I report only covers a point in time, so Susan needs an SOC Type II report to have the information she requires to make a design and operating effectiveness decision based on the report.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a wireless network penetration test, Susan runs aircrack-ng against the network using a password file. What might cause her to fail in her password-cracking efforts? A. Use of WPA2 encryption B. Running WPA2 in Enterprise mode C. Use of WEP encryption D. Running WPA2 in PSK mode ->","completion":" B. WPA2 enterprise uses RADIUS authentication for users rather than a preshared key. This means a password attack is more likely to fail as password attempts for a given user may result in account lockout. WPA2 encryption will not stop a password attack, and WPA2's preshared key mode is specifically targeted by password attacks that attempt to find the key. Not only is WEP encryption outdated, but it can also frequently be cracked quickly by tools like aircrack-ng.\n"}
{"prompt":"A zero-day vulnerability is announced for the popular Apache web server in the middle of a workday. In Jacob's role as an information security analyst, he needs to quickly scan his network to determine what servers are vulnerable to the issue. What is Jacob's best route to quickly identify vulnerable systems? A. Immediately run Nessus against all of the servers to identify which systems are vulnerable. B. Review the CVE database to find the vulnerability information and patch information. C. Create a custom IDS or IPS signature. D. Identify affected versions and check systems for that version number using an automated scanner. ->","completion":" D. In many cases when an exploit is initially reported, there are no prebuilt signatures or detections for vulnerability scanners, and the CVE database may not immediately have information about the attack. Jacob's best option is to quickly gather information and review potentially vulnerable servers based on their current configuration. As more information becomes available, signatures and CVE information are likely to be published. Unfortunately for Jacob, IDS and IPS signatures will only detect attacks and won't detect whether systems are vulnerable unless he sees the systems being exploited.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of testing is used to ensure that separately developed software modules properly exchange data? A. Fuzzing B. Dynamic testing C. Interface testing D. API checksums ->","completion":" C. Interface testing is used to ensure that software modules properly meet interface specifications and thus will properly exchange data. Dynamic testing tests software in a running environment, whereas fuzzing is a type of dynamic testing that feeds invalid input to running software to test error and input handling. API checksums are not a testing technique.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not a potential problem with active wireless scanning? A. Accidently scanning apparent rogue devices that actually belong to guests B. Causing alarms on the organization's wireless IPS C. Scanning devices that belong to nearby organizations D. Misidentifying rogue devices ->","completion":" B. Not only should active scanning be expected to cause wireless IPS alarms, but they may actually be desired if the test is done to test responses. Accidentally scanning guests or neighbors or misidentifying devices belonging to third parties are all potential problems with active scanning and require the security assessor to carefully verify the systems that she is scanning.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben uses a fuzzing tool that tests an application by developing data models and creating fuzzed data based on information about how the application uses data. What type of fuzzing is Ben doing? A. Mutation B. Parametric C. Generational D. Derivative ->","completion":" C. Generational fuzzing relies on models for application input and conducts fuzzing attacks based on that information. Mutation-based fuzzers are sometimes called \"dumb\" fuzzers because they simply mutate or modify existing data samples to create new test samples. Neither parametric nor derivative is a term used to describe types of fuzzers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Saria wants to log and review traffic information between parts of her network. What type of network logging should she enable on her routers to allow her to perform this analysis? A. Audit logging B. Flow logging C. Trace logging D. Route logging ->","completion":" B. Flows, also often called network flows, are captured to provide insight into network traffic for security, troubleshooting, and performance management. Audit logging provides information about events on the routers, route logging is not a common network logging function, and trace logs are used in troubleshooting specific software packages as they perform their functions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim has been contracted to conduct a gray box penetration test, and his clients have provided him with the following information about their networks so that he can scan them: Data center: 10.10.10.0\/24 Sales: 10.10.11.0\/24 Billing: 10.10.12.0\/24 Wireless: 192.168.0.0\/16 What problem will Jim encounter if he is contracted to conduct a scan from offsite? A. The IP ranges are too large to scan efficiently. B. The IP addresses provided cannot be scanned. C. The IP ranges overlap and will cause scanning issues. D. The IP addresses provided are RFC 1918 addresses. ->","completion":" D. The IP addresses that his clients have provided are RFC 1918 nonroutable IP addresses, and Jim will not be able to scan them from offsite. To succeed in his penetration test, he will have to either first penetrate their network border or place a machine inside their network to scan from the inside. IP addresses overlapping is not a real concern for scanning, and the ranges can easily be handled by current scanning systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Karen's organization has been performing system backups for years but has not used the backups frequently. During a recent system outage, when administrators tried to restore from backups, they found that the backups had errors and could not be restored. Which of the following options should Karen avoid when selecting ways to ensure that her organization's backups will work next time? A. Log review B. MTD verification C. Hashing D. Periodic testing ->","completion":" B. Karen can't use MTD verification because MTD is the Maximum Tolerable Downtime. Verifying it will only tell her how long systems can be offline without significant business impact. Reviewing logs, using hashing to verify that the logs are intact, and performing periodic tests are all valid ways to verify that the backups are working properly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jennifer needs to ensure that all Windows systems provide identical logging information to the SIEM. How can she best ensure that all Windows desktops have the same log settings? A. Perform periodic configuration audits. B. Use Group Policy. C. Use Local Policy. D. Deploy a Windows syslog client. ->","completion":" B. Group Policy enforced by Active Directory can ensure consistent logging settings and can provide regular enforcement of policy on systems. Periodic configuration audits won't catch changes made between audits, and local policies can drift due to local changes or differences in deployments. A Windows syslog client will enable the Windows systems to send syslog to the SIEM appliance but won't ensure consistent logging of events.\n"}
{"prompt":"During normal operations, Jennifer's team uses the SIEM appliance to monitor for exceptions received via syslog. What system shown does not natively have support for syslog events? A. Enterprise wireless access points B. Windows desktop systems C. Linux web servers D. Enterprise firewall devices ->","completion":" B. Windows systems generate logs in the Windows native logging format. To send syslog events, Windows systems require a helper application or tool. Enterprise wireless access points, firewalls, and Linux systems all typically support syslog.\n"}
{"prompt":"What technology should an organization use for each of the devices shown in the diagram to ensure that logs can be time sequenced across the entire infrastructure? A. Syslog B. NTP C. Logsync D. SNAP ->","completion":" B. Network Time Protocol (NTP) can ensure that systems are using the same time, allowing time sequencing for logs throughout a centralized logging infrastructure. Syslog is a way for systems to send logs to a logging server and won't address time sequencing. Neither logsync nor SNAP is an industry term.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a penetration test, Danielle needs to identify systems, but she hasn't gained sufficient access on the system she is using to generate raw packets. What type of scan should she run to verify the most open services? A. A TCP connect scan B. A TCP SYN scan C. A UDP scan D. An ICMP scan ->","completion":" A. When a tester does not have raw packet creation privileges, such as when they have not escalated privileges on a compromised host, a TCP connect scan can be used. TCP SYN scans require elevated privileges on most Linux systems due to the need to write raw packets. A UDP scan will miss most services that are provided via TCP, and an ICMP is merely a ping sweep of systems that respond to pings and won't identify services at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a port scan using nmap, Joseph discovers that a system shows two ports open that cause him immediate worry: 21\/open 23\/open What services are likely running on those ports? A. SSH and FTP B. FTP and Telnet C. SMTP and Telnet D. POP3 and SMTP ->","completion":" B. Joseph may be surprised to discover FTP (TCP port 21) and Telnet (TCP port 23) open on his network since both services are unencrypted and have been largely replaced by SSH, and SCP or SFTP. SSH uses port 22, SMTP uses port 25, and POP3 uses port 110.\n"}
{"prompt":"Saria's team is working to persuade their management that their network has extensive vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. If she wants to conduct a realistic attack as part of a penetration test, what type of penetration test should she conduct? A. Crystal box B. Gray box C. White box D. Black box ->","completion":" D. Black box testing is the most realistic type of penetration test because it does not provide the penetration tester with inside information about the configuration or design of systems, software, or networks. A gray box test provides some information, whereas a white or crystal box test provides significant or full detail.\n"}
{"prompt":"What method is commonly used to assess how well software testing covered the potential uses of an application? A. A test coverage analysis B. A source code review C. A fuzz analysis D. A code review report ->","completion":" A. A test coverage analysis is often used to provide insight into how well testing covered the set of use cases that an application is being tested for. Source code reviews look at the code of a program for bugs, not necessarily at a use case analysis, whereas fuzzing tests invalid inputs. A code review report might be generated as part of a source code review.\n"}
{"prompt":"Testing that is focused on functions that a system should not allow are an example of what type of testing? A. Use case testing B. Manual testing C. Misuse case testing D. Dynamic testing ->","completion":" C. Testing how a system could be misused, or misuse testing, focuses on behaviors that are not what the organization desires or that are counter to the proper function of a system or application. Use case testing is used to verify whether a desired functionality works. Dynamic testing is used to determine how code handles variables that change over time, whereas manual testing is just what it implies: testing code by hand.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of monitoring uses simulated traffic to a website to monitor performance? A. Log analysis B. Synthetic monitoring C. Passive monitoring D. Simulated transaction analysis ->","completion":" B. Synthetic monitoring uses emulated or recorded transactions to monitor for performance changes in response time, functionality, or other performance monitors. Passive monitoring uses a span port or other method to copy traffic and monitor it in real time. Log analysis is typically performed against actual log data but can be performed on simulated traffic to identify issues. Simulated transaction analysis is not an industry term.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following vulnerabilities is unlikely to be found by a web vulnerability scanner? A. Path disclosure B. Local file inclusion C. Race condition D. Buffer overflow ->","completion":" C. Path disclosures, local file inclusions, and buffer overflows are all vulnerabilities that may be found by a web vulnerability scanner, but race conditions that take advantage of timing issues tend to be found either by code analysis or using automated tools that specifically test for race conditions as part of software testing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim uses a tool that scans a system for available services and then connects to them to collect banner information to determine what version of the service is running. It then provides a report detailing what it gathers, basing results on service fingerprinting, banner information, and similar details it gathers combined with CVE information. What type of tool is Jim using? A. A port scanner B. A service validator C. A vulnerability scanner D. A patch management tool ->","completion":" C. Vulnerability scanners that do not have administrative rights to access a machine or that are not using an agent scan remote machines to gather information, including fingerprints from responses to queries and connections, banner information from services, and related data. CVE information is Common Vulnerability and Exposure information, or vulnerability information. A port scanner gathers information about what service ports are open, although some port scanners blur the line between port and vulnerability scanners. Patch management tools typically run as an agent on a system to allow them to both monitor patch levels and update the system as needed. Service validation typically involves testing the functionality of a service, not its banner and response patterns.\n"}
{"prompt":"Emily builds a script that sends data to a web application that she is testing. Each time the script runs, it sends a series of transactions with data that fits the expected requirements of the web application to verify that it responds to typical customer behavior. What type of transactions is she using, and what type of test is this? A. Synthetic, passive monitoring B. Synthetic, use case testing C. Actual, dynamic monitoring D. Actual, fuzzing ->","completion":" B. Emily is using synthetic transactions, which can use recorded or generated transactions, and is conducting use case testing to verify that the application responds properly to actual use cases. Neither actual data nor dynamic monitoring is an industry term. Fuzzing involves sending unexpected inputs to a program to see how it responds. Passive monitoring uses a network tap or other capture technology to allow monitoring of actual traffic to a system or application.\n"}
{"prompt":"What passive monitoring technique records all user interaction with an application or website to ensure quality and performance? A. Client\/server testing B. Real user monitoring C. Synthetic user monitoring D. Passive user recording ->","completion":" B. Real user monitoring (RUM) is a passive monitoring technique that records user interaction with an application or system to ensure performance and proper application behavior. RUM is often used as part of a predeployment process using the actual user interface. The other answers are all made up鈥攕ynthetic monitoring uses simulated behavior, but synthetic user monitoring is not a testing method. Similarly, passive monitoring monitors actual traffic, but passive user recording is not an industry term or technique. Client\/server testing merely describes one possible architecture.\n"}
{"prompt":"Earlier this year, the information security team at Jim's employer identified a vulnerability in the web server that Jim is responsible for maintaining. He immediately applied the patch and is sure that it installed properly, but the vulnerability scanner has continued to incorrectly flag the system as vulnerable due to the version number it is finding even though Jim is sure the patch is installed. Which of the following options is Jim's best choice to deal with the issue? A. Uninstall and reinstall the patch. B. Ask the information security team to flag the system as patched and not vulnerable. C. Update the version information in the web server's configuration. D. Review the vulnerability report and use alternate remediation options. ->","completion":" B. Jim should ask the information security team to flag the issue as resolved if he is sure the patch was installed. Many vulnerability scanners rely on version information or banner information and may flag patched versions if the software provider does not update the information they see. Uninstalling and reinstalling the patch will not change this. Changing the version information may not change all of the details that are being flagged by the scanner and may cause issues at a later date. Reviewing the vulnerability information for a workaround may be a good idea but should not be necessary if the proper patch is installed; it can create maintenance issues later.\n"}
{"prompt":"Angela wants to test a web browser's handling of unexpected data using an automated tool. What tool should she choose? A. Nmap B. zzuf C. Nessus D. Nikto ->","completion":" B. zzuf is the only fuzzer on the list, and zzuf is specifically designed to work with tools like web browsers, image viewers, and similar software by modifying network and file input to application.

Vulnerability assessment B. Misuse case testing C. Threat categorization D. Penetration test planning ->","completion":" C. An important part of application threat modeling is threat categorization. It helps to assess attacker goals that influence the controls that should be put in place. The other answers all involve topics that are not directly part of application threat modeling.\n"}
{"prompt":"Why should passive scanning be conducted in addition to implementing wireless security technologies like wireless intrusion detection systems? A. It can help identify rogue devices. B. It can test the security of the wireless network via scripted attacks. C. Their short dwell time on each wireless channel can allow them to capture more packets. D. They can help test wireless IDS or IPS systems. ->","completion":" A. Passive scanning can help identify rogue devices by capturing MAC address vendor IDs that do not match deployed devices, by verifying that systems match inventories of organizationally owned hardware by hardware address, and by monitoring for rogue SSIDs or connections. Scripted attacks are part of active scanning rather than passive scanning, and active scanning is useful for testing IDS or IPS systems, whereas passive scanning will not be detected by detection systems. Finally, a shorter dwell time can actually miss troublesome traffic, so balancing dwell time versus coverage is necessary for passive wireless scanning efforts.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a penetration test, Lauren is asked to test the organization's Bluetooth security. Which of the following is not a concern she should explain to her employers? A. Bluetooth scanning can be time-consuming. B. Many devices that may be scanned are likely to be personal devices. C. Bluetooth passive scans may require multiple visits at different times to identify all targets. D. Bluetooth active scans can't evaluate the security mode of Bluetooth devices. ->","completion":" D. Bluetooth active scans can determine both the strength of the PIN and what security mode the device is operating in. Unfortunately, Bluetooth scans can be challenging due to the limited range of Bluetooth and the prevalence of personally owned Bluetooth enabled devices. Passive Bluetooth scanning only detects active connections and typically requires multiple visits to have a chance of identifying all devices.\n"}
{"prompt":"What term describes software testing that is intended to uncover new bugs introduced by patches or configuration changes? A. Nonregression testing B. Evolution testing C. Smoke testing D. Regression testing ->","completion":" D. Regression testing, which is a type of functional or unit testing, tests to ensure that changes have not introduced new issues. Nonregression testing checks to see whether a change has had the effect it was supposed to, smoke testing focuses on simple problems with impact on critical functionality, and evolution testing is not a software testing technique.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the tools cannot identify a target's operating system for a penetration tester? A. Nmap B. Nessus C. Nikto D. sqlmap ->","completion":" D. Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto all have OS fingerprinting or other operating system identification capabilities. sqlmap is designed to perform automated detection and testing of SQL injection flaws and does not provide OS detection.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan needs to predict high-risk areas for her organization and wants to use metrics to assess risk trends as they occur. What should she do to handle this? A. Perform yearly risk assessments. B. Hire a penetration testing company to regularly test organizational security. C. Identify and track key risk indicators. D. Monitor logs and events using a SIEM device. ->","completion":" C. Key risk indicators are used to tell those in charge of risk management how risky an activity is and how much impact changes are having on that risk profile. Identifying key risk indicators and monitoring them can help to identify high-risk areas earlier in their lifecycle. Yearly risk assessments may be a good idea, but only provide a point-in-time view, whereas penetration tests may miss out on risks that are not directly security related. Monitoring logs and events using a SIEM device can help detect issues as they occur but won't necessarily show trends in risk.\n"}
{"prompt":"What major difference separates synthetic and passive monitoring? A. Synthetic monitoring only works after problems have occurred. B. Passive monitoring cannot detect functionality issues. C. Passive monitoring only works after problems have occurred. D. Synthetic monitoring cannot detect functionality issues. ->","completion":" C. Passive monitoring only works after issues have occurred because it requires actual traffic. Synthetic monitoring uses simulated or recorded traffic and thus can be used to proactively identify problems. Both synthetic and passive monitoring can be used to detect functionality issues.\n"}
{"prompt":"What task is the most important during Phase 1, Planning? A. Building a test lab B. Getting authorization C. Gathering appropriate tools D. Determining if the test is white, black, or gray box ->","completion":" B. Getting authorization is the most critical element in the planning phase. Permission, and the \"get out of jail free card\" that demonstrates that organizational leadership is aware of the issues that a penetration test could cause, is the first step in any penetration test. Gathering tools and building a lab, as well as determining what type of test will be conducted, are all important, but nothing should happen without permission.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following tools is most likely to be used during discovery? A. Nessus B. john C. Nmap D. Nikto ->","completion":" C. Discovery can include both active and passive discovery. Port scanning is commonly done during discovery to assess what services the target provides, and nmap is one of the most popular tools used for this purpose. Nessus and Nikto might be used during the vulnerability scanning phase, and john, a password cracker, can be used to recover passwords during the exploitation phase.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of these concerns is the most important to address during planning to ensure that the reporting phase does not cause problems? A. Which CVE format to use B. How the vulnerability data will be stored and sent C. Which targets are off-limits D. How long the report should be ->","completion":" B. Penetration test reports often include information that could result in additional exposure if they were accidentally released or stolen. Therefore, determining how vulnerability data should be stored and sent is critical. Problems with off-limits targets are more likely to result in issues during the vulnerability assessment and exploitation phase, and reports should not be limited in length but should be as long as they need to be to accomplish the goals of the test.\n"}
{"prompt":"What four types of coverage criteria are commonly used when validating the work of a code testing suite? A. Input, statement, branch, and condition coverage B. Function, statement, branch, and condition coverage C. API, branch, bounds, and condition coverage D. Bounds, branch, loop, and condition coverage ->","completion":" B. Code coverage testing most frequently requires that every function has been called, that each statement has been executed, that all branches have been fully explored, and that each condition has been evaluated for all possibilities. API, input, and loop testing are not common types of code coverage testing measures.\n"}

{"prompt":"What does using unique user IDs for all users provide when reviewing logs? A. Confidentiality B. Integrity C. Availability D. Accountability ->","completion":" D. Unique user IDs provide accountability when paired with auditable logs to provide that a specific user took any given action. Confidentiality, availability, and integrity can be provided through other means like encryption, systems design, and digital signatures.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not an interface that is typically tested during the software testing process? A. APIs B. Network interfaces C. UIs D. Physical interfaces ->","completion":" B. Application programming interfaces (APIs), user interfaces (UIs), and physical interfaces are all important to test when performing software testing. Network interfaces are not a part of the typical list of interfaces tested in software testing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alan's organization uses the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to standardize its vulnerability management program. Which component of SCAP can Alan use to reconcile the identity of vulnerabilities generated by different security assessment tools? A. OVAL B. XCCDF C. CVE D. SCE ->","completion":" C. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database provides a consistent reference for identifying security vulnerabilities. The Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) is used to describe the security condition of a system. The Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) is used to create security checklists in a standardized fashion. The Script Check Engine (SCE) is designed to make scripts interoperable with security policy definitions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Misconfiguration, logical and functional flaws, and poor programming practices are all causes of what common security issue? A. Fuzzing B. Security vulnerabilities C. Buffer overflows D. Race conditions ->","completion":" B. Security vulnerabilities can be created by misconfiguration, logical or functional design or implementation issues, or poor programming practices. Fuzzing is a method of software testing and is not a type of issue. Buffer overflows and race conditions are both caused by logical or programming flaws, but they are not typically caused by misconfiguration or functional issues.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following strategies is not a reasonable approach for remediating a vulnerability identified by a vulnerability scanner? A. Install a patch. B. Use a workaround fix. C. Update the banner or version number. D. Use an application layer firewall or IPS to prevent attacks against the identified vulnerability. ->","completion":" C. Simply updating the version that an application provides may stop the vulnerability scanner from flagging it, but it won't fix the underlying issue. Patching, using workarounds, or installing an application layer firewall or IPS can all help to remediate or limit the impact of the vulnerability.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a penetration test Saria calls her target's help desk claiming to be the senior assistant to an officer of the company. She requests that the help desk reset the officer's password because of an issue with his laptop while traveling and persuades them to do so. What type of attack has she successfully completed? A. Zero knowledge B. Help desk spoofing C. Social engineering D. Black box ->","completion":" C. Saria's social-engineering attack succeeded in persuading a staff member at the help desk to change a password for someone who they not only couldn't see, but who they couldn't verify actually needed their password reset. Black box and zero knowledge are both terms describing penetration tests without information about the organization or system, and help desk spoofing is not an industry term.\n"}
{"prompt":"In this image, what issue may occur due to the log handling settings? A. Log data may be lost when the log is archived. B. Log data may be overwritten. C. Log data may not include needed information. D. Log data may fill the system disk. ->","completion":" D. The menu shown will archive logs when they reach the maximum size allowed (20 MB). These archives will be retained, which could fill the disk. Log data will not be overwritten, and log data should not be lost when the data is archived. The question does not include enough information to determine if needed information may not be logged.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not a hazard associated with penetration testing? A. Application crashes B. Denial of service C. Exploitation of vulnerabilities D. Data corruption ->","completion":" C. Penetration tests are intended to help identify vulnerabilities, and exploiting them is part of the process rather than a hazard. Application crashes; denial of service due to system, network, or application failures; and even data corruption can all be hazards of penetration tests.\n"}

{"prompt":"Lauren's team conducts regression testing on each patch that they release. What key performance measure should they maintain to measure the effectiveness of their testing? A. Time to remediate vulnerabilities B. A measure of the rate of defect recurrence C. A weighted risk trend D. A measure of the specific coverage of their testing ->","completion":" B. Lauren's team is using regression testing, which is intended to prevent the recurrence of issues. This means that measuring the rate of defect recurrence is an appropriate measure for their work. Time to remediate vulnerabilities is associated with activities like patching, rather than preparing the patch, whereas a weighted risk trend is used to measure risk over time to an organization. Finally, specific coverage may be useful to determine if they are fully testing their effort, but regression testing is more specifically covered by defect recurrence rates.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following types of code review is not typically performed by a human? A. Software inspections B. Code review C. Static program analysis D. Software walkthroughs ->","completion":" C. Static program reviews are typically performed by an automated tool.

What type of testing environment does her team need to ensure complete code coverage? A. White box B. Gray box C. Black box D. Dynamic ->","completion":" A. In order to fully test code, a white box test is required. Without full visibility of the code, error conditions or other code could be missed, making a gray box or black box test an inappropriate solution. Using dynamic testing that runs against live code could also result in some conditions being missed due to sections of code not being exposed to typical usage.\n"}
{"prompt":"As part of the continued testing of their new application, Susan's quality assurance team has designed a set of test cases for a series of black box tests. These functional tests are then run, and a report is prepared explaining what has occurred. What type of report is typically generated during this testing to indicate test metrics? A. A test coverage report B. A penetration test report C. A code coverage report D. A line coverage report ->","completion":" A. A test coverage report measures how many of the test cases have been completed and is used as a way to provide test metrics when using test cases. A penetration test report is provided when a penetration test is conducted鈥攖his is not a penetration test. A code coverage report covers how much of the code has been tested, and a line coverage report is a type of code coverage report.\n"}

{"prompt":"Jim is working with a penetration testing contractor who proposes using Metasploit as part of her penetration testing effort. What should Jim expect to occur when Metasploit is used? A. Systems will be scanned for vulnerabilities. B. Systems will have known vulnerabilities exploited. C. Services will be probed for buffer overflow and other unknown flaws. D. Systems will be tested for zero-day exploits. ->","completion":" B. Metasploit is an exploitation package that is designed to assist penetration testers. A tester using Metasploit can exploit known vulnerabilities for which an exploit has been created or can create their own exploits using the tool. While Metasploit provides built-in access to some vulnerability scanning functionality, a tester using Metasploit should primarily be expected to perform actual tests of exploitable vulnerabilities. Similarly, Metasploit supports creating buffer overflow attacks, but it is not a purpose-built buffer overflow testing tool, and of course testing systems for zero-day exploits doesn't work unless they have been released.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan needs to ensure that the interactions between the components of her e-commerce application are all handled properly. She intends to verify communications, error handling, and session management capabilities throughout her infrastructure. What type of testing is she planning to conduct? A. Misuse case testing B. Fuzzing C. Regression testing D. Interface testing ->","completion":" D. Susan is conducting interface testing. Interface testing involves testing system or application components to ensure that they work properly together. Misuse case testing focuses on how an attacker might misuse the application and would not test normal cases. Fuzzing attempts to send unexpected input and might be involved in interface testing, but it won't cover the full set of concerns. Regression testing is conducted when testing changes and is used to ensure that the application or system functions as it did before the update or change.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jim is designing his organization's log management systems and knows that he needs to carefully plan to handle the organization's log data. Which of the following is not a factor that Jim should be concerned with? A. The volume of log data B. A lack of sufficient log sources C. Data storage security requirements D. Network bandwidth ->","completion":" B. Not having enough log sources is not a key consideration in log management system design, although it may be a worry for security managers who can't capture the data they need. Log management system designs must take into account the volume of log data and the network bandwidth it consumes, the security of the data, and the amount of effort required to analyze the data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ken is having difficulty correlating information from different security teams in his organization. Specifically, he would like to find a way to describe operating systems in a consistent fashion. What SCAP component can assist him? A. CVE B. CPE C. CWE D. OVAL ->","completion":" B. The Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) component of SCAP provides a consistent way to refer to operating systems and other system components.

{"prompt":"During a review of access logs, Alex notices that Danielle logged into her workstation in New York at 8 a.m. daily but that she was recorded as logging into her department's main web application shortly after 3 a.m. daily. What common logging issue has Alex likely encountered? A. Inconsistent log formatting B. Modified logs C. Inconsistent timestamps D. Multiple log sources ->","completion":" C. Inconsistent time stamps are a common problem, often caused by improperly set time zones or due to differences in how system clocks are set. In this case, a consistent time difference often indicates that one system uses local time, and the other is using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Logs from multiple sources tend to cause problems with centralization and collection, whereas different log formats can create challenges in parsing log data. Finally, modified logs are often a sign of intrusion or malicious intent.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of vulnerability scan accesses configuration information from the systems it is run against as well as information that can be accessed via services available via the network? A. Authenticated scans B. Web application scans C. Unauthenticated scans D. Port scans ->","completion":" A. Authenticated scans use a read-only account to access configuration files, allowing more accurate testing of vulnerabilities. Web application, unauthenticated scans, and port scans don't have access to configuration files unless they are inadvertently exposed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben's development team needs to address an authorization issue, resulting in an elevation of privilege threat. Which of the following controls is most appropriate to this type of issue? A. Auditing and logging is enabled. B. Role-based access control is used for specific operations. C. Data type and format checks are enabled. D. User input is tested against a whitelist. ->","completion":" B. Microsoft's STRIDE threat assessment model places threats into one of six categories: -Spoofing鈥攖hreats that involve user credentials and authentication, or falsifying legitimate communications -Tampering鈥攖hreats that involve the malicious modification of data -Repudiation鈥攖hreats that cause actions to occur that cannot be denied by a user -Information disclosure鈥攖hreats that involve exposure of data to unauthorized individuals -Denial of service鈥攖hreats that deny service to legitimate users -Elevation of privilege鈥攖hreats that provide higher privileges to unauthorized users Using role-based access controls (RBACs) for specific operations will help to ensure that users cannot perform actions that they should not be able to. Auditing and logging can help detect abuse but won't prevent it, and data type, format checks, and whitelisting are all useful for preventing attacks like SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks but are not as directly aimed at authorization issues.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben's team is attempting to categorize a transaction identification issue that is caused by use of a symmetric key shared by multiple servers. What STRIDE category should this fall into? A. Information disclosure B. Denial of service C. Tampering D. Repudiation ->","completion":" D. Since a shared symmetric key could be used by any of the servers, transaction identification problems caused by a shared key are likely to involve a repudiation issue. If encrypted transactions cannot be uniquely identified by server, they cannot be proved to have come from a specific server.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben wants to prevent or detect tampering with data. Which of the following is not an appropriate solution? A. Hashes B. Digital signatures C. Filtering D. Authorization controls ->","completion":" C. Filtering is useful for preventing denial of service attacks but won't prevent tampering with data. Hashes and digital signatures can both be used to verify the integrity of data, and authorization controls can help ensure that only those with the proper rights can modify the data.\n"}

{"prompt":"Ryan is considering the use of fuzz testing in his web application testing program. Which one of the following limitations of fuzz testing should Ryan consider when making his decision? A. They often find only simple faults. B. Testers must manually generate input. C. Fuzzers may not fully cover the code. D. Fuzzers can't reproduce errors. ->","completion":" B. Fuzz testers are capable of automatically generating input sequences to test an application. Therefore, testers do not need to manually generate input, although they may do so if they wish. Fuzzers can reproduce errors (and thus, \"fuzzers can't reproduce errors\" is not an issue) but typically don't fully cover the code鈥攃ode coverage tools are usually paired with fuzzers to validate how much coverage was possible. Fuzzers are often limited to simple errors because they won't handle business logic or attacks that require knowledge from the application user.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ken is designing a testing process for software developed by his team. He is designing a test that verifies that every line of code was executed during the test. What type of analysis is Ken performing? A. Branch coverage B. Condition coverage C. Function coverage D. Statement coverage ->","completion":" D. Statement coverage tests verify that every line of code was executed during the test. Branch coverage verifies that every if statement was executed under all if and else conditions. Condition coverage verifies that every logical test in the code was executed under all sets of inputs. Function coverage verifies that every function in the code was called and returns results.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Ben is conducting a penetration test, what should his next step be after receiving these results? A. Connect to the web server using a web browser. B. Connect via Telnet to test for vulnerable accounts. C. Identify interesting ports for further scanning. D. Use sqlmap against the open databases. ->","completion":" C. After scanning for open ports using a port scanning tool like nmap, penetration testers will identify interesting ports and then conduct vulnerability scans to determine what services may be vulnerable. This will perform many of the same activities that connecting via a web server will and will typically be more useful than trying to manually test for vulnerable accounts via Telnet. sqlmap would typically be used after a vulnerability scanner identifies additional information about services, and the vulnerability scanner will normally provide a wider range of useful information.\n"}
{"prompt":"Based on the scan results, what operating system (OS) was the system that was scanned most likely running? A. Windows Desktop B. Linux C. Network device D. Windows Server ->","completion":" B. The system is likely a Linux system. The system shows X11, as well as login, shell, and nfs ports, all of which are more commonly found on Linux systems than Windows systems or network devices. This system is also very poorly secured; many of the services running on it should not be exposed in a modern secure network.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben's manager expresses concern about the coverage of his scan. Why might his manager have this concern? A. Ben did not test UDP services. B. Ben did not discover ports outside the \"well-known ports.\" C. Ben did not perform OS fingerprinting. D. Ben tested only a limited number of ports. ->","completion":" D. Nmap only scans 1000 TCP and UDP ports by default, including ports outside the 0-1024 range of \"well-known\" ports. By using the defaults for nmap, Ben missed 64,535 ports.

{"prompt":"What technique has been used to protect the intellectual property in the following image? A. Steganography B. Clipping C. Sampling D. Watermarking ->","completion":" D. The image clearly contains the watermark of the US Geological Survey (USGS), which ensures that anyone seeing the image knows its origin. It is not possible to tell from looking at the image whether steganography was used. Sampling and clipping are data analysis techniques and are not used to protect images.\n"}
{"prompt":"You are working to evaluate the risk of flood to an area and consult the flood maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). According to those maps, the area lies within a 200-year flood plain. What is the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) of a flood in that region? A. 200 B. 0.01 C. 0.02 D. 0.005 ->","completion":" D. The annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is the expected number of times an incident will occur each year. In the case of a 200-year flood plain, planners should expect a flood once every 200 years. This is equivalent to a 1\/200 chance of a flood in any given year, or 005 floods per year.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following individuals poses the greatest risk to security in most welldefended organizations? A. Political activist B. Malicious insider C. Script kiddie D. Thrill attacker ->","completion":" B. While all hackers with malicious intent pose a risk to the organization, the malicious insider poses the greatest risk to security because they likely have legitimate access to sensitive systems that may be used as a launching point for an attack. Other attackers do not begin with this advantage.\n"}
{"prompt":"Veronica is considering the implementation of a database recovery mechanism recommended by a consultant. In the recommended approach, an automated process will move database backups from the primary facility to an offsite location each night. What type of database recovery technique is the consultant describing? A. Remote journaling B. Remote mirroring C. Electronic vaulting D. Transaction logging ->","completion":" C. In an electronic vaulting approach, automated technology moves database backups from the primary database server to a remote site on a scheduled basis, typically daily. Transaction logging is not a recovery technique alone; it is a process for generating the logs used in remote journaling. Remote journaling transfers transaction logs to a remote site on a more frequent basis than electronic vaulting, typically hourly. Remote mirroring maintains a live database server at the backup site and mirrors all transactions at the primary site on the server at the backup site.\n"}
{"prompt":"When designing an access control scheme, Hilda set up roles so that the same person does not have the ability to provision a new user account and assign superuser privileges to an account. What information security principle is Hilda following? A. Least privilege B. Separation of duties C. Job rotation D. Security through obscurity ->","completion":" B. Hilda's design follows the principle of separation of duties. Giving one user the ability to both create new accounts and grant administrative privileges combines two actions that would result in a significant security change that should be divided among two users.\n"}
{"prompt":"Reggie recently received a letter from his company's internal auditors scheduling the kickoff meeting for an assessment of his group. Which of the following should Reggie not expect to learn during that meeting? A. Scope of the audit B. Purpose of the audit C. Expected timeframe D. Expected findings ->","completion":" D. An audit kickoff meeting should clearly describe the scope and purpose of the audit as well as the expected time frame. Auditors should never approach an audit with any expectations about what they will discover because the findings should only be developed based upon the results of audit examinations.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following events marks the completion of a disaster recovery process? A. Securing property and life safety B. Restoring operations in an alternate facility C. Restoring operations in the primary facility D. Standing down first responders ->","completion":" C.

What type of attack took place? A. Denial of service B. Privilege escalation C. Reconnaissance D. Brute force ->","completion":" B. The scenario describes a privilege escalation attack where a malicious insider with authorized access to a system misused that access to gain privileged credentials.\n"}
{"prompt":"Carla has worked for her company for 15 years and has held a variety of different positions. Each time she changed positions, she gained new privileges associated with that position, but no privileges were ever taken away. What concept describes the sets of privileges she has accumulated? A. Entitlement B. Aggregation C. Transitivity D. Isolation ->","completion":" B. Carla's account has experienced aggregation, where privileges accumulated over time. This condition is also known as privilege creep and likely constitutes a violation of the least privilege principle.\n"}
{"prompt":"During what phase of the incident response process do administrators take action to limit the effect or scope of an incident? A. Detection B. Response C. Mitigation D. Recovery ->","completion":" C. The Mitigation phase of incident response focuses on actions that can contain the damage incurred during an incident. This includes limiting the scope and or effectiveness of the incident.\n"}
{"prompt":"At this point in the incident response process, what term best describes what has occurred in Ann's organization? A. Security occurrence B. Security incident C. Security event D. Security intrusion ->","completion":" C. At this point in the process, Ann has no reason to believe that any actual security compromise or policy violation took place, so this situation does not meet the criteria for a security incident or intrusion. Rather, the alert generated by the intrusion detection system is simply a security event requiring further investigation. Security occurrence is not a term commonly used in incident handling.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ann continues her investigation and realizes that the traffic generating the alert is abnormally high volumes of inbound UDP traffic on port 53. What service typically uses this port? A. DNS B. SSH\/SCP C. SSL\/TLS D. HTTP ->","completion":" A. DNS traffic commonly uses port 53 for both TCP and UDP communications. SSH and SCP use TCP port 22. SSL and TLS do not have ports assigned to them but are commonly used for HTTPS traffic on port 443. Unencrypted web traffic over HTTP often uses port 80.\n"}
{"prompt":"As Ann analyzes the traffic further, she realizes that the traffic is coming from many different sources and has overwhelmed the network, preventing legitimate uses. The inbound packets are responses to queries that she does not see in outbound traffic. The responses are abnormally large for their type. What type of attack should Ann suspect? A. Reconnaissance B. Malicious code C. System penetration D. Denial of service ->","completion":" D. The attack described in this scenario has all of the hallmarks of a denial of service attack. More specifically, Ann's organization is likely experiencing a DNS amplification attack where an attacker sends false requests to third-party DNS servers with a forged source IP address belonging to the targeted system. Because the attack uses UDP requests, there is no three-way handshake. The attack packets are carefully crafted to elicit a lengthy response from a short query. The purpose of these queries is to generate responses headed to the target system that are sufficiently large and numerous enough to overwhelm the targeted network or system.\n"}
{"prompt":"Now that Ann understands that an attack has taken place that violates her organization's security policy, what term best describes what has occurred in Ann's organization? A. Security occurrence B. Security incident C. Security event D. Security intrusion ->","completion":" B. Now that Ann suspects an attack against her organization, she has sufficient evidence to declare a security incident. The attack under way seems to have undermined the availability of her network, meeting one of the criteria for a security incident. This is an escalation beyond a security event but does not reach the level of an intrusion because there is no evidence that the attacker has even attempted to gain access to systems on Ann's network. Security occurrence is not a term commonly used in incident handling.\n"}
{"prompt":"Frank is seeking to introduce a hacker's laptop in court as evidence against the hacker. The laptop does contain logs that indicate the hacker committed the crime, but the court ruled that the search of the apartment that resulted in police finding the laptop was unconstitutional. What admissibility criteria prevents Frank from introducing the laptop as evidence? A. Materiality B. Relevance C. Hearsay D. Competence ->","completion":" D. To be admissible, evidence must be relevant, material, and competent. The laptop in this case is clearly material because it contains logs related to the crime in question. It is also relevant because it provides evidence that ties the hacker to the crime. It is not competent because the evidence was not legally obtained.\n"}

Gordon's investigation may include examining the contents of hard disks, network traffic, and any other systems or information belonging to the company. D. Gordon may ethically perform \"hack back\" activities after identifying the perpetrator. ->","completion":" C. Gordon may conduct his investigation as he wishes and use any information that is legally available to him, including information and systems belonging to his employer. There is no obligation to contact law enforcement. However, Gordon may not perform \"hack back\" activities because those may constitute violations of the law and\/or (ISC)2 Code of Ethics.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following tools provides an organization with the greatest level of protection against a software vendor going out of business? A. Service level agreement B. Escrow agreement C. Mutual assistance agreement D. PCI DSS compliance agreement ->","completion":" B. Software escrow agreements place a copy of the source code for a software package in the hands of an independent third party who will turn the code over to the customer if the vendor ceases business operations. Service level agreements, mutual assistance agreements, and compliance agreements all lose some or all of their effectiveness if the vendor goes out of business.\n"}
{"prompt":"Fran is considering new human resources policies for her bank that will deter fraud. She plans to implement a mandatory vacation policy. What is typically considered the shortest effective length of a mandatory vacation? A. Two days B. Four days C. One week D. One month ->","completion":" C. Most security professionals recommend at least one, and preferably two, weeks of vacation to deter fraud. The idea is that fraudulent schemes will be uncovered during the time that the employee is away and does not have the access required to perpetuate a cover-up.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following events would constitute a security incident? An attempted network intrusion A successful database intrusion A malware infection A violation of a confidentiality policy An unsuccessful attempt to remove information from a secured area A. 2, 3, and 4 B. 1, 2, and 3 C. 4 and 5 D.

{"prompt":"Allie is responsible for reviewing authentication logs on her organization's network. She does not have the time to review all logs, so she decides to choose only records where there have been four or more invalid authentication attempts. What technique is Allie using to reduce the size of the pool? A. Sampling B. Random selection C. Clipping D. Statistical analysis ->","completion":" C. The two main methods of choosing records from a large pool for further analysis are sampling and clipping. Sampling uses statistical techniques to choose a sample that is representative of the entire pool, while clipping uses threshold values to select those records that exceed a predefined threshold because they may be of most interest to analysts.\n"}
{"prompt":"You are performing an investigation into a potential bot infection on your network and wish to perform a forensic analysis of the information that passed between different systems on your network and those on the Internet. You believe that the information was likely encrypted. You are beginning your investigation after the activity concluded. What would be the best and easiest way to obtain the source of this information? A. Packet captures B. Netflow data C. Intrusion detection system logs D. Centralized authentication records ->","completion":" B. Netflow data contains information on the source, destination, and size of all network communications and is routinely saved as a matter of normal activity. Packet capture data would provide relevant information, but it must be captured during the suspicious activity and cannot be re-created after the fact unless the organization is already conducting 100 percent packet capture, which is very rare. Additionally, the use of encryption limits the effectiveness of packet capture. Intrusion detection system logs would not likely contain relevant information because the encrypted traffic would probably not match intrusion signatures. Centralized authentication records would not contain information about network traffic.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following tools helps system administrators by providing a standard, secure template of configuration settings for operating systems and applications? A. Security guidelines B. Security policy C. Baseline configuration D. Running configuration ->","completion":" C. Baseline configurations serve as the starting point for configuring secure systems and applications. They contain the security settings necessary to comply with an organization's security policy and may then be customized to meet the specific needs of an implementation. While security policies and guidelines may contain information needed to secure a system, they do not contain a set of configuration settings that may be applied to a system. The running configuration of a system is the set of currently applied settings, which may or may not be secure.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of disaster recovery test activates the alternate processing facility and uses it to conduct transactions but leaves the primary site up and running? A. Full interruption test B. Parallel test C. Checklist review D. Tabletop exercise ->","completion":" B. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"During which phase of the incident response process would an analyst receive an intrusion detection system alert and verify its accuracy? A. Response B. Mitigation C. Detection D.

{"prompt":"What level of RAID is also known as disk mirroring? A. RAID-0 B. RAID-1 C. RAID-5 D. RAID-10 ->","completion":" B. RAID level 1 is also known as disk mirroring. RAID-0 is called disk striping. RAID-5 is called disk striping with parity. RAID-10 is known as a stripe of mirrors.\n"}
{"prompt":"Bruce is seeing quite a bit of suspicious activity on his network. It appears that an outside entity is attempting to connect to all of his systems using a TCP connection on port 22. What type of scanning is the outsider likely engaging in? A. FTP scanning B. Telnet scanning C. SSH scanning D. HTTP scanning ->","completion":" C. SSH uses TCP port 22, so this attack is likely an attempt to scan for open or weakly secured SSH servers. FTP uses ports 20 and 21. Telnet uses port 23, and HTTP uses port 80.\n"}
{"prompt":"The historic ping of death attack is most similar to which of the following modern attack types? A. SQL injection B. Cross-site scripting C. Buffer overflow D. Brute-force password cracking ->","completion":" C. The ping of death attack placed more data than allowed by the specification in the payload of an ICMP echo request packet. This is similar to the modern-day buffer overflow attack where attackers attempt to place more data in a targeted system's memory that consumes more space than is allocated for that data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Roger recently accepted a new position as a security professional at a company that runs its entire IT infrastructure within an IaaS environment. Which one of the following would most likely be the responsibility of Roger's firm? A. Configuring the network firewall B. Applying hypervisor updates C. Patching operating systems D. Wiping drives prior to disposal ->","completion":" C. In an infrastructure as a service environment, the vendor is responsible for hardwareand network-related responsibilities.

{"prompt":"What technique can application developers use to test applications in an isolated virtualized environment before allowing them on a production network? A. Penetration testing B. Sandboxing C. White box testing D. Black box testing ->","completion":" B. Sandboxing is a technique where application developers (or the recipients of an untrusted application) may test the code in a virtualized environment that is isolated from production systems. White box testing, black box testing, and penetration testing are all common software testing techniques but do not require the use of an isolated system.\n"}
{"prompt":"Gina is the firewall administrator for a small business and recently installed a new firewall. After seeing signs of unusually heavy network traffic, she checked the intrusion detection system, which reported that a SYN flood attack was under way. What firewall configuration change can Gina make to most effectively prevent this attack? A. Block SYN from known IPs. B. Block SYN from unknown IPs. C. Enable SYN-ACK spoofing at the firewall. D. Disable TCP. ->","completion":" C. While it may not immediately seem like the obvious answer, many firewalls have a built-in anti鈥揝YN flood defense that responds to SYNs on behalf of protected systems. Once the remote system proves to be a legitimate connection by continuing the three-way handshake, the rest of the TCP session is passed through. If the connection proves to be an attack, the firewall handles the additional load using appropriate mitigation techniques. Blocking SYNs from known or unknown IP addresses is likely to cause issues with systems that should be able to connect, and turning off TCP will break most modern network services!\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of trust relationship extends beyond the two domains participating in the trust to one or more of their subdomains? A. Transitive trust B. Inheritable trust C. Nontransitive trust D. Noninheritable trust ->","completion":" A. Transitive trusts go beyond the two domains directly involved in the trust relationship and extend to their subdomains.\n"}

Aggregation is a security issue that arises when a collection of facts has a higher classification than the classification of any of those facts standing alone. An inference problem occurs when an attacker can pull together pieces of less sensitive information and use them to derive information of greater sensitivity. SQL injection is a web application exploit. Multilevel security is a system control that allows the simultaneous processing of information at different classification levels.\n"}
{"prompt":"What are the two types of covert channels that are commonly exploited by attackers seeking to surreptitiously exfiltrate information? A. Timing and storage B. Timing and firewall C. Storage and memory D. Firewall and storage ->","completion":" A. The two major classifications of covert channels are timing and storage. A covert timing channel conveys information by altering the performance of a system component or modifying a resource's timing in a predictable manner. A covert storage channel conveys information by writing data to a common storage area where another process can read it. There is no such thing as a covert firewall channel. Memory is a type of storage, so a memory-based covert channel would fit into the covert storage channel category.\n"}
{"prompt":"Vivian would like to hire a software tester to come in and evaluate a new web application from a user's perspective. Which of the following tests best simulates that perspective? A. Black box B. Gray box C. Blue box D. White box ->","completion":" A. Black box testing begins with no prior knowledge of the system implementation, simulating a user perspective.

{"prompt":"Referring to the database transaction shown here, what would happen if no account exists in the Accounts table with account number 1001? A. The database would create a new account with this account number and give it a $250 balance. B. The database would ignore that command and still reduce the balance of the second account by $250. C. The database would roll back the transaction, ignoring the results of both commands. D. The database would generate an error message. ->","completion":" B. In this example, the two SQL commands are indeed bundled in a transaction, but it is not an error to issue an update command that does not match any rows. Therefore, the first command would \"succeed\" in updating zero rows and not generate an error or cause the transaction to roll back. The second command would then execute, reducing the balance of the second account by $250.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of malware is characterized by spreading from system to system under its own power by exploiting vulnerabilities that do not require user intervention? A. Trojan horse B. Virus C. Logic bomb D. Worm ->","completion":" D. Worms have built-in propagation mechanisms that do not require user interaction, such as scanning for systems containing known vulnerabilities and then exploiting those vulnerabilities to gain access. Viruses and Trojan horses typically require user interaction to spread. Logic bombs do not spread from system to system but lie in wait until certain conditions are met, triggering the delivery of their payload.\n"}
{"prompt":"Kim is troubleshooting an application firewall that serves as a supplement to the organization's network and host firewalls and intrusion prevention system, providing added protection against web-based attacks. The issue the organization is experiencing is that the firewall technology suffers somewhat frequent restarts that render it unavailable for 10 minutes at a time. What configuration might Kim consider to maintain availability during that period at the lowest cost to the company? A. High availability cluster B. Failover device C. Fail open D. Redundant disks ->","completion":" C. A fail open configuration may be appropriate in this case. In this configuration, the firewall would continue to pass traffic without inspection while it is restarting. This would minimize downtime, and the traffic would still be protected by the other security controls described in the scenario. Failover devices and high availability clusters would indeed increase availability, but at potentially significant expense. Redundant disks would not help in this scenario because no disk failure is described.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of security issue arises when an attacker can deduce a more sensitive piece of information by analyzing several pieces of information classified at a lower level? A. SQL injection B. Multilevel security C. Aggregation D. Inference ->","completion":" D. An inference problem occurs when an attacker can pull together pieces of less sensitive information and use them to derive information of greater sensitivity. Aggregation is a security issue that arises when a collection of facts has a higher classification than the classification of any of those facts standing alone. SQL injection is a web application exploit. Multilevel security is a system control that allows the simultaneous processing of information at different classification levels.\n"}
{"prompt":"Greg is battling a malware outbreak in his organization. He used specialized malware analysis tools to capture samples of the malware from three different systems and noticed that the code is changing slightly from infection to infection. Greg believes that this is the reason that antivirus software is having a tough time defeating the outbreak. What type of malware should Greg suspect is responsible for this security incident? A. Stealth virus B. Polymorphic virus C. Multipartite virus D. Encrypted virus ->","completion":" B. Polymorphic viruses mutate each time they infect a system by making adjustments to their code that assists them in evading signature detection mechanisms. Encrypted viruses also mutate from infection to infection but do so by encrypting themselves with different keys on each device.\n"}
{"prompt":"What vulnerability definitely exists on Linda's message board? A. Cross-site scripting B. Cross-site request forgery C. SQL injection D. Improper authentication ->","completion":" A. The message forum is clearly susceptible to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The code that Linda discovered in the message is a definitive example of an attempt to conduct cross-site scripting, and the alert box that she received demonstrates that the vulnerability exists. The website may also be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, SQL injection, improper authentication, and other attacks, but there is no evidence of this provided in the scenario.\n"}
{"prompt":"What was the likely motivation of the user who posted the message on the forum containing this code? A. Reconnaissance B. Theft of sensitive information C. Credential stealing D. Social engineering ->","completion":" A. The script that Linda discovered merely pops up a message on a user's screen and does not perform any more malicious action. This type of script, using an alert() call, is commonly used to probe websites for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\n"}
{"prompt":"Linda communicates with the vendor and determines that no patch is available to correct this vulnerability. Which one of the following devices would best help her defend the application against further attack? A. VPN B. WAF C. DLP D. IDS ->","completion":" B. Web application firewalls (WAFs) sit in front of web applications and watch for potentially malicious web attacks, including cross-site scripting. They then block that traffic from reaching the web application. An intrusion detection system (IDS) may detect the attack but is unable to take action to prevent it. DLP and VPN solutions are unable to detect web application attacks.\n"}
{"prompt":"In further discussions with the vendor, Linda finds that they are willing to correct the issue but do not know how to update their software. What technique would be most effective in mitigating the vulnerability of the application to this type of attack? A. Bounds checking B. Peer review C. Input validation D. OS patching ->","completion":" C. Input validation verifies that user-supplied input does not violate security conditions and is the most effective defense against cross-site scripting attacks. Bounds checking is a form of input validation, but it is used to ensure that numeric input falls within an acceptable range and is not applicable against cross-site scripting attacks. Peer review and OS patching are both good security practices but are unlikely to be effective against a cross-site scripting attack.\n"}
{"prompt":"What property of relational databases ensures that once a database transaction is committed to the database, it is preserved? A. Atomicity B. Consistency C. Durability D. Isolation ->","completion":" C. Durability requires that once a transaction is committed to the database it must be preserved. Atomicity ensures that if any part of a database transaction fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back as if it never occurred. Consistency ensures that all transactions are consistent with the logical rules of the database, such as having a primary key. Isolation requires that transactions operate separately from each other.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren wants to use software review process for the application she is working on. Which of the following processes would work best if she is a remote worker who works different hours from the rest of her team? A. Pass around B. Pair programming C. Team review D. Fagan inspection ->","completion":" A. Pass-around reviews are often done via email or using a central code review system, allowing developers to review code asynchronously. Pair programming requires two programmers to work together, with one writing code and the other reviewing and tracking progress. Team reviews are typically done in a group, and Fagan inspection is a formal review process that would involve both the developer and a team to review the code using a formal process.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is not a technique used by virus authors to hide the existence of their virus from antimalware software? A. Stealth B. Multipartitism C. Polymorphism D. Encryption ->","completion":" B. Multipartite viruses use multiple propagation mechanisms to defeat system security controls but do not necessarily include techniques designed to hide the malware from antivirus software. Stealth viruses tamper with the operating system to hide their existence. Polymorphic viruses alter their code on each system they infect to defeat signature detection. Encrypted viruses use a similar technique, employing encryption to alter their appearance and avoid signature detection mechanisms.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following types of software testing usually occurs last and is executed against test scenarios? A. Unit testing B. Integration testing C. User acceptance testing D. System testing ->","completion":" C. User acceptance testing (UAT) is typically the last phase of the testing process. It verifies that the solution developed meets user requirements and validates it against use cases. Unit testing, integration testing, and system testing are all conducted earlier in the process leading up to UAT.\n"}

Which one of the following rules is NOT a best practice that Lisa can configure at her network border? A. Block packets with internal source addresses from entering the network. B. Block packets with external source addresses from leaving the network. C. Block packets with private IP addresses from exiting the network. D. Block packets with public IP addresses from entering the network. ->","completion":" D. This question is asking you to identify the blocking rule that should NOT be set on the firewall. Packets with public IP addresses will routinely be allowed to enter the network, so you should not create a rule to block them, making this the correct answer. Packets with internal source addresses should never originate from outside the network, so they should be blocked from entering the network. Packets with external source addresses should never be found on the internal network, so they should be blocked from leaving the network. Finally, private IP addresses should never be used on the Internet, so packets containing private IP addresses should be blocked from leaving the network.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of attack is demonstrated in the following C programming language example? int myarray[10]; myarray[10] = 8; A. Mismatched data types B. Overflow C. SQL injection D. Covert channel ->","completion":" B. This is an example of a specific type of buffer overflow known as an off-by-one error. The first line of the code defines an array of 10 elements, which would be numbered 0 through 9. The second line of code tries to place a value in the 11th element of the array (remember, array counting begins at 0!), which would cause an overflow.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following database issues occurs when one transaction writes a value to the database that overwrites a value that was needed by transactions with earlier precedence? A. Dirty read B. Incorrect summary C. Lost update D. SQL injection ->","completion":" C. Lost updates occur when one transaction writes a value to the database that overwrites a value needed by transactions that have earlier precedence, causing those transactions to read an incorrect value. Dirty reads occur when one transaction reads a value from a database that was written by another transaction that did not commit. Incorrect summaries occur when one transaction is using an aggregate function to summarize data stored in a database while a second transaction is making modifications to the database, causing the summary to include incorrect information. SQL injection is a web application security flaw, not a database concurrency problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is the most effective control against session hijacking attacks? A. TLS B. Complex session cookies C. SSL D. Expiring cookies frequently ->","completion":" A. Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides the most effective defense against session hijacking because it encrypts all traffic between the client and server, preventing the attacker from stealing session credentials. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) also encrypts traffic, but it is vulnerable to attacks against its encryption technology. Complex and expiring cookies are a good idea, but they are not sufficient protection against session hijacking.\n"}
{"prompt":"Faith is looking at the \/etc\/passwd file on a system configured to use shadowed passwords. When she examines a line in the file for a user with interactive login permissions, what should she expect to see in the password field? A. Plaintext password B. Hashed password C. x D. * ->","completion":" C. When a system uses shadowed passwords, the hashed password value is stored in \/etc\/shadow instead of \/etc\/passwd. The \/etc\/passwd file would not contain the password in plaintext or hashed form. Instead, it would contain an x to indicate that the password hash is in the shadow file. The * character is normally used to disable interactive logins to an account.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of vulnerability does a TOCTOU attack target? A. Lack of input validation B. Race condition C. Injection flaw D. Lack of encryption ->","completion":" B. Time of check to time of use (TOCTOU) attacks target situations where there is a race condition, meaning that a dependence on the timing of actions allows impermissible actions to take place.\n"}
{"prompt":"While evaluating a potential security incident, Harry comes across a log entry from a web server request showing that a user entered the following input into a form field: CARROT'&1=1;-- What type of attack was attempted? A. Buffer overflow B. Cross-site scripting C. SQL injection D. Cross-site request forgery ->","completion":" C. The single quotation mark in the input field is a telltale sign that this is a SQL injection attack. The quotation mark is used to escape outside the SQL code's input field, and the text following is used to directly manipulate the SQL command sent from the web application to the database.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is not an effective control against SQL injection attacks? A. Escaping B. Client-side input validation C. Parameterization D. Limiting database permissions ->","completion":" B. Client-side input validation is not an effective control against any type of attack because the attacker can easily bypass the validation by altering the code on the client. Escaping restricted characters prevents them from being passed to the database, as does parameterization. Limiting database permissions prevents dangerous code from executing.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of project management tool is shown in the figure? A. WBS chart B. PERT chart C. Gantt chart D. Wireframe diagram ->","completion":" B. PERT charts use nodes to represent milestones or deliverables and then show the estimated time to move between milestones. Gantt charts use a different format with a row for each task and lines showing the expected duration of the task. Work breakdown structures are an earlier deliverable that divides project work into achievable tasks. Wireframe diagrams are used in web design.\n"}
{"prompt":"In what software testing technique does the evaluator retest a large number of scenarios each time that the software changes to verify that the results are consistent with a standard baseline? A. Orthogonal array testing B. Pattern testing C. Matrix testing D. Regression testing ->","completion":" D. Regression testing is performed after developers make changes to an application. It reruns a number of test cases and compares the results to baseline results. Orthogonal array testing is a method for generating test cases based on statistical analysis. Pattern testing uses records of past software bugs to inform the analysis. Matrix testing develops a matrix of all possible inputs and outputs to inform the test plan.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following conditions may make an application most vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack? A. Input validation B. Reflected input C. Unpatched server D. Promiscuous firewall rules ->","completion":" B. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks may take advantage of the use of reflected input in a web application where input provided by one user is displayed to another user. Input validation is a control used to prevent XSS attacks. XSS does not require an unpatched server or any firewall rules beyond those permitting access to the web application.\n"}
{"prompt":"Roger is conducting a software test for a tax preparation application developed by his company. End users will access the application over the Web, but Roger is conducting his test on the back end, evaluating the source code on the web server. What type of test is Roger conducting? A. White box B. Gray box C. Blue box D. Black box ->","completion":" A. In a white box test, the attacker has access to full implementation details of the system, including source code, prior to beginning the test. In gray box testing, the attacker has partial knowledge.

{"prompt":"Which of the following statements is true about heuristic-based antimalware software? A. It has a lower false positive rate than signature detection. B. It requires frequent definition updates to detect new malware. C. It has a higher likelihood of detecting zero-day exploits than signature detection. D. It monitors systems for files with content known to be viruses. ->","completion":" C. Heuristic-based antimalware software has a higher likelihood of detecting a zero-day exploit than signature-based methods. Heuristic-based software does not require frequent signature updates because it does not rely upon monitoring systems for the presence of known malware. The trade-off with this approach is that it has a higher false positive rate than signature detection methods.\n"}
{"prompt":"Martin is inspecting a system where the user reported unusual activity, including disk activity when the system is idle and abnormal CPU and network usage. He suspects that the machine is infected by a virus but scans come up clean. What malware technique might be in use here that would explain the clean scan results? A. File infector virus B. MBR virus C. Service injection virus D. Stealth virus ->","completion":" D. One possibility for the clean scan results is that the virus is using stealth techniques, such as intercepting read requests from the antivirus software and returning a correctlooking version of the infected file. The system may also be the victim of a zero-day attack, using a virus that is not yet included in the signature definition files provided by the antivirus vendor.\n"}

{"prompt":"What application security process can be described in these three major steps? Decomposing the application Determining and ranking threats Determining countermeasures and mitigation A. Fagan inspection B. Threat modeling C. Penetration testing D. Code review ->","completion":" B. Threat modeling commonly involves decomposing the application to understand it and how it interacts with other components or users. Next, identifying and ranking threats allows you to focus on the threats that should be prioritized. Finally, identifying how to mitigate those threats finishes the process. Once complete, an organization can take action to handle the threats that were identified with appropriate controls.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following approaches to failure management is the most conservative from a security perspective? A. Fail open B. Fail mitigation C. Fail clear D. Fail closed ->","completion":" D. The fail closed approach prevents any activity from taking place during a system security failure and is the most conservative approach to failure management. Fail open takes the opposite philosophy, allowing all activity in the event of a security control failure. Fail clear and fail mitigation are not failure management approaches.\n"}
{"prompt":"What software development model is shown in the figure? A. Waterfall B. Agile C. Lean D. Spiral ->","completion":" D. The illustration shows the spiral model of software development. In this approach, developers use multiple iterations of a waterfall-style software development process. This becomes a \"loop\" of iterations through similar processes. The waterfall approach does not iterate through the entire process repeatedly but rather only allows movement backward and forward one stage. The Agile approach to software development focuses on iterative improvement and does not follow a rigorous SDLC model. Lean is a process improvement methodology and not a software development model.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following database keys is used by an RDBMS to uniquely identify each row in a database table? A. Foreign key B. Primary key C. Candidate key D. Referential key ->","completion":" B. Relational databases use the primary key to uniquely identify each of the rows in a table. The primary key is selected by the database designer from the set of candidate keys that are able to uniquely identify each row, but the RDBMS only uses the primary key for this purpose. Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables. Referential keys are not a type of database key.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following change management processes is initiated by users rather than developers? A. Request control B. Change control C. Release control D.

{"prompt":"What technique do API developers most commonly use to limit access to an API to authorized individuals and applications? A. Encryption B. Input validation C. API keys D. IP filters ->","completion":" C. API developers commonly use API keys to limit access to authorized users and applications. Encryption provides for confidentiality of information exchanged using an API but does not provide authentication. Input validation is an application security technique used to protect against malicious input. IP filters may be used to limit access to an API, but they are not commonly used because it is difficult to deploy an API with IP filters since the filters require constant modification and maintenance as endpoints change.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following statements about malware is correct? A. Malware authors do not target Macintosh or Linux systems. B. The most reliable way to detect known malware is watching for unusual system activity. C. Signature detection is the most effective technique to combat known malware. D. APT attackers typically use malware designed to exploit vulnerabilities identified in security bulletins. ->","completion":" C. Signature detection is extremely effective against known strains of malware because it uses a very reliable pattern matching technique to identify known malware. Signature detection is, therefore, the most reliable way to detect known malware. This technique is not, however, effective against the zero-day malware typically used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) that does not exploit vulnerabilities identified in security bulletins. While malware authors once almost exclusively targeted Windows systems, malware now exists for all major platforms.\n"}

{"prompt":"Which one of the following database concurrency issues occurs when one transaction reads information that was written to a database by a second transaction that never committed? A. Lost update B. SQL injection C. Incorrect summary D. Dirty read ->","completion":" D. Dirty reads occur when one transaction reads a value from a database that was written by another transaction that did not commit. Lost updates occur when one transaction writes a value to the database that overwrites a value needed by transactions that have earlier precedence, causing those transactions to read an incorrect value. Incorrect summaries occur when one transaction is using an aggregate function to summarize data stored in a database while a second transaction is making modifications to the database, causing the summary to include incorrect information. SQL injection is a web application security flaw, not a database concurrency problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of virus works by altering the system boot process to redirect the BIOS or UEFI firmware to load malware before the operating system loads? A. File infector B. MBR C. Polymorphic D. Service injection ->","completion":" B. A master boot record (MBR) virus redirects the boot process to load malware during the operating system loading process.

Reporting errors sent by the device to the forensic host D. Blocking read commands sent to the device ->","completion":" D. A forensic disk controller performs four functions. One of those, write blocking, intercepts write commands sent to the device and prevents them from modifying data on the device. The other three functions include returning data requested by a read operation, returning access-significant information from the device, and reporting errors from the device back to the forensic host. The controller should not prevent read commands from being sent to the device because those commands may return crucial information.\n"}
{"prompt":"Mike is building a fault-tolerant server and wishes to implement RAID 1. How many physical disks are required to build this solution? A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 5 ->","completion":" B. RAID 1, disk mirroring, requires two physical disks that will contain copies of the same data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which Kerberos service generates a new ticket and session keys and sends them to the client? A. KDC B. TGT C. AS D. TGS ->","completion":" D. The TGS, or Ticket-Granting Service (which is usually on the same server as the KDC), receives a TGT from the client. It validates the TGT and the user's rights to access the service they are requesting to use. The TGS then issues a ticket and session keys to the client. The AS serves as the authentication server, which forwards the username to the KDC. It's worth noting that the client doesn't communicate with the KDC directly. Instead, it will communicate with the TGT and the AS, which means KDC isn't an appropriate answer here.\n"}
{"prompt":"Communication systems that rely on start and stop flags or bits to manage data transmission are known as what type of communication? A. Analog B. Digital C. Synchronous D. Asynchronous ->","completion":" D. Asynchronous communications rely on a built-in stop and start flag or bit.

What type of firewall is Susan using? A. A static packet filtering firewall B. An application-level gateway firewall C. A stateful packet inspection firewall D. A circuit-level gateway firewall ->","completion":" C. Stateful packet inspection firewalls, also known as dynamic packet filtering firewalls, track the state of a conversation and can allow a response from a remote system based on an internal system being allowed to start the communication. Static packet filtering and circuit-level gateways only filter based on source, destination, and ports, whereas application-level gateway firewalls proxy traffic for specific applications.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can Ben provide access control for his customers without having to provision user IDs before they connect while also gathering useful contact information for his business purposes? A. WPA2 PSK B. A captive portal C. Require customers to use a publicly posted password like \"BensCoffee.\" D. Port security ->","completion":" B. A captive portal can require those who want to connect to and use WiFi to provide an email address to connect. This allows Ben to provide easy-to-use wireless while meeting his business purposes. WPA2 PSK is the preshared key mode of WPA and won't provide information about users who are given a key. Sharing a password doesn't allow for data gathering either. Port security is designed to protect wired network ports based on MAC addresses.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben intends to run an open (unencrypted) wireless network. How should he connect his business devices? A. Run WPA2 on the same SSID. B. Set up a separate SSID using WPA2. C. Run the open network in Enterprise mode. D. Set up a separate wireless network using WEP. ->","completion":" B. Many modern wireless routers can provide multiple SSIDs. Ben can create a private, secure network for his business operations, but he will need to make sure that the customer and business networks are firewalled or otherwise logically separated from each other. Running WPA2 on the same SSID isn't possible without creating another wireless network and would cause confusion for customers (SSIDs aren't required to be unique). Running a network in Enterprise mode isn't used for open networks, and WEP is outdated and incredibly vulnerable.\n"}
{"prompt":"After implementing the solution from the first question, Ben receives a complaint about users in his cafe hijacking other customers' web traffic, including using their usernames and passwords. How is this possible? A. The password is shared by all users, making traffic vulnerable. B. A malicious user has installed a Trojan on the router. C. A user has ARP spoofed the router, making all traffic broadcast to all users. D. Open networks are unencrypted, making traffic easily sniffable. ->","completion":" D. Unencrypted open networks broadcast traffic in the clear. This means that unencrypted sessions to websites can be easily captured with a packet sniffer. Some tools like FireSheep have been specifically designed to capture sessions from popular websites. Fortunately, many now use TLS by default, but other sites still send user session information in the clear. Shared passwords are not the cause of the vulnerability, ARP spoofing isn't an issue with wireless networks, and a Trojan is designed to look like safe software, not to compromise a router.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is not a mode of operation for the Data Encryption Standard? A. CBC B. CFB C. OFB D. AES ->","completion":" D. The DES modes of operation are Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and Counter (CTR).

A. A pass-the-hash attack B. A brute-force attack C. A man-in-the-middle attack D. A dictionary attack ->","completion":" B. Brute-force attacks try every possible password. In this attack, the password is changing by one letter at each attempt, which indicates that it is a brute-force attack. A dictionary attack would use dictionary words for the attack, whereas a man-in-the-middle or pass-the-hash attack would most likely not be visible in an authentication log except as a successful login.\n"}
{"prompt":"What property of a relational database ensures that two executing transactions do not affect each other by storing interim results in the database? A. Atomicity B. Isolation C. Consistency D. Durability ->","completion":" B. Isolation requires that transactions operate separately from each other. Atomicity ensures that if any part of a database transaction fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back as if it never occurred. Consistency ensures that all transactions are consistent with the logical rules of the database, such as having a primary key. Durability requires that once a transaction is committed to the database it must be preserved.\n"}
{"prompt":"Kim is the system administrator for a small business network that is experiencing security problems. She is in the office in the evening working on the problem, and nobody else is there. As she is watching, she can see that systems on the other side of the office that were previously behaving normally are now exhibiting signs of infection. What type of malware is Kim likely dealing with? A. Virus B. Worm C. Trojan horse D. Logic bomb ->","completion":" B. Worms have built-in propagation mechanisms that do not require user interaction, such as scanning for systems containing known vulnerabilities and then exploiting those vulnerabilities to gain access. Viruses and Trojan horses typically require user interaction to spread. Logic bombs do not spread from system to system but lie in wait until certain conditions are met, triggering the delivery of their payload.\n"}

{"prompt":"Frank is the security administrator for a web server that provides news and information to people located around the world. His server received an unusually high volume of traffic that it could not handle and was forced to reject requests. Frank traced the source of the traffic back to a botnet. What type of attack took place? A. Denial of service B. Reconaissance C. Compromise D. Malicious insider ->","completion":" A. This is a clear example of a denial of service attack鈥攄enying legitimate users authorized access to the system through the use of overwhelming traffic. It goes beyond a reconnaissance attack because the attacker is affecting the system, but it is not a compromise because the attacker did not attempt to gain access to the system. There is no reason to believe that a malicious insider was involved.\n"}
{"prompt":"In the database table shown here, which column would be the best candidate for a primary key? 1 2 3 234 Main Street 1024 Sample Street 913 Sorin Street MD FL IN 21040 33131 46556 (301) 555-1212 (305) 555-1995 (574) 555-5863 14 14 26 Columbia Miami South Bend Acme Widgets Abrams Consulting Dome Widgets Company ID Company Name Address City State ZIP Code Telephone Sales Rep A. Company ID B. Company Name C. ZIP Code D. Sales Rep ->","completion":" A. The Company ID is likely unique for each row in the table, making it the best choice for a primary key. There may be multiple companies that share the same name or ZIP code. Similarly, a single sales representative likely serves more than one company, making those fields unsuitable for use as a unique identifier.\n"}

A. 12.8.195.15 B. 10.8.15.9 C. 192.168.109.55 D. 129.53.44.124 ->","completion":" D. 129.53.44.124 is a valid public IP address and a legitimate destination for traffic leaving Bob's network. 12.8.195.15 is a public address on Bob's network and should not be a destination address on a packet leaving the network. 10.8.15.9 and 192.168.109.55 are both private IP addresses that should not be routed to the Internet.\n"}
{"prompt":"How many possible keys exist in a cryptographic algorithm that uses 6-bit encryption keys? A. 12 B. 16 C. 32 D. 64 ->","completion":" D. Binary keyspaces contain a number of keys equal to 2 raised to the power of the number of bits. Two to the sixth power is 64, so a 6-bit keyspace contains 64 possible keys. The number of viable keys is usually smaller in most algorithms due to the presence of parity bits and other algorithmic overhead or security issues that restrict the use of some key values.\n"}
{"prompt":"What problem drives the recommendation to physically destroy SSD drives to prevent data leaks when they are retired? A. Degaussing only partially wipes the data on SSDs. B. SSDs don't have data remanence. C. SSDs are unable to perform a zero fill. D. The built-in erase commands are not completely effective on some SSDs. ->","completion":" D. Research has shown that traditional methods of sanitizing files on SSDs were not reliable. SSDs remap data sectors as part of wear leveling, and erase commands are not consistently effective across multiple SSD brands. Zero fills can be performed on SSDs but may not be effective, much like erase commands. Degaussing doesn't work on SSDs because they are flash media, rather than magnetic media.\n"}

{"prompt":"When an attacker calls an organization's help desk and persuades them to reset a password for them due to the help desk employee's trust and willingness to help, what type of attack succeeded? A. A human Trojan B. Social engineering C. Phishing D. Whaling ->","completion":" B. Social engineering exploits humans to allow attacks to succeed. Since help desk employees are specifically tasked with being helpful, they may be targeted by attackers posing as legitimate employees. Trojans are a type of malware, whereas phishing is a targeted attack via electronic communication methods intended to capture passwords or other sensitive data. Whaling is a type of phishing aimed at high-profile or important targets.\n"}
{"prompt":"When a user attempts to log into their online account, Google sends a text message with a code to their cell phone. What type of verification is this? A. Knowledge-based authentication B. Dynamic knowledge鈥揵ased authentication C. Out-of-band identity proofing D. Risk-based identity proofing ->","completion":" C. Identity proofing that relies on a type of verification outside the initial environment that required the verification is out-of-band identity proofing. This type of verification relies on the owner of the phone or phone number having control of it but removes the ability for attackers to use only Internet-based resources to compromise an account. Knowledge-based authentication relies on answers to preselected information, whereas dynamic knowledge鈥揵ased authentication builds questions using facts or data about the user. Risk-based identity proofing uses risk-based metrics to determine whether identities should be permitted or denied access. It is used to limit fraud in financial transactions, such as credit card purchases. This is a valid form of proofing but does not necessarily use an out-of-band channel, such as SMS.\n"}
{"prompt":"What mathematical operation, when substituted for the blank lines shown here, would make the equations correct? A. MOD B. XOR C. NAND D. DIV ->","completion":" A. The modulo function is the remainder value left over after an integer division operation takes place.\n"}
{"prompt":"If availability of authentication services is the organization's biggest priority, what type of identity platform should Ben recommend? A. Onsite B. Cloud based C. Hybrid D. Outsourced ->","completion":" C. A hybrid authentication service can provide authentication services both in the cloud and on-premises, ensuring that service outages due to interrupted links are minimized. An onsite service would continue to work during an Internet outage but would not allow the e-commerce website to authenticate. A cloud service would leave the corporate location offline. Outsourcing authentication does not indicate whether the solution is on- or offpremise and thus isn't a useful answer.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Ben needs to share identity information with the business partner shown, what should he investigate? A. Single sign-on B. Multifactor authentication C. Federation D. IDaaS ->","completion":" C. Federation links identity information between multiple organizations. Federating with a business partner can allow identification and authorization to occur between them, making integration much easier. Single sign-on would reduce the number of times a user has to log in but will not facilitate the sharing of identity information. Multifactor can help secure authentication, but again doesn't help integrate with a third party. Finally, an identity as a service provider might provide federation but doesn't guarantee it.\n"}
{"prompt":"What technology is likely to be involved when Ben's organization needs to provide authentication and authorization assertions to their cloud e-commerce application? A. Active Directory B. SAML C. RADIUS D. SPML ->","completion":" B. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is frequently used to integrate cloud services and provides the ability to make authentication and authorization assertions. Active Directory integrations are possible but are less common for cloud service providers, and RADIUS is not typically used for integrations like this. Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) is used to provision users, resources, and services, not for authentication and authorization.\n"}
{"prompt":"Dave is responsible for password security in his organization and would like to strengthen the security of password files. He would like to defend his organization against the use of rainbow tables. Which one of the following techniques is specifically designed to frustrate the use of rainbow tables? A. Password expiration policies B. Salting C. User education D. Password complexity policies ->","completion":" B. Rainbow tables use precomputed password hashes to conduct cracking attacks against password files. They may be frustrated by the use of salting, which adds a specified value to the password prior to hashing, making it much more difficult to perform precomputation. Password expiration policies, password complexity policies, and user education may all contribute to password security, but they are not direct defenses against the use of rainbow tables.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is a single system designed to attract attackers because it seemingly contains sensitive information or other attractive resources? A. Honeynet B. Darknet C. Honeypot D. Pseudoflaw ->","completion":" C. A honeypot is a decoy computer system used to bait intruders into attacking. A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots that creates a more sophisticated environment for intruders to explore. A pseudoflaw is a false vulnerability in a system that may attract an attacker. A darknet is a segment of unused network address space that should have no network activity and, therefore, may be easily used to monitor for illicit activity.\n"}
{"prompt":"When evaluating biometric devices, what is another term used to describe the equal error rate? A. FAR B. FRR C. CER D. ERR ->","completion":" C. The crossover error rate (CER) is the point where both the false acceptance rate and the false rejection rate cross. CER and ERR, or equal error rate, mean the same thing and are used interchangeably.\n"}

{"prompt":"Sean suspects that an individual in his company is smuggling out secret information despite his company's careful use of data loss prevention systems. He discovers that the suspect is posting photos, including the one shown here, to public Internet message boards. What type of technique may the individuals be using to hide messages inside this image? A. Watermarking B. VPN C. Steganography D. Covert timing channel ->","completion":" C. Steganography is the art of using cryptographic techniques to embed secret messages within other content. Steganographic algorithms work by making invisible alterations to files, such as modifying the least significant bits of the many bits that make up image files. VPNs may be used to obscure secret communications, but they provide protection in transit and can't be used to embed information in an image. Watermarking does embed information in an image but with the intent of protecting intellectual property. A still image would not be used for a covert timing channel because it is a fixed file.\n"}
{"prompt":"Roger is concerned that a third-party firm hired to develop code for an internal application will embed a backdoor in the code. The developer retains rights to the intellectual property and will only deliver the software in its final form. Which one of the following languages would be least susceptible to this type of attack because it would provide Roger with code that is human-readable in its final form? A. JavaScript B. C C. C++ D. Java ->","completion":" A. JavaScript is an interpreted language so the code is not compiled prior to execution, allowing Roger to inspect the contents of the code. C, C++, and Java are all compiled languages鈥攁 compiler produces an executable file that is not human-readable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jesse is looking at the \/etc\/passwd file on a system configured to use shadowed passwords. What should she expect to see in the password field of this file? A. Plaintext passwords B. Encrypted passwords C. Hashed passwords D. x ->","completion":" D.

{"prompt":"What principle states that an individual should make every effort to complete his or her responsibilities in an accurate and timely manner? A. Least privilege B. Separation of duties C. Due care D. Due diligence ->","completion":" D. The due care principle states that an individual should react in a situation using the same level of care that would be expected from any reasonable person. It is a very broad standard. The due diligence principle is a more specific component of due care that states that an individual assigned a responsibility should exercise due care to complete it accurately and in a timely manner.\n"}
{"prompt":"What penetration testing technique can best help assess training and awareness issues? A. Port scanning B. Discovery C. Social engineering D. Vulnerability scanning ->","completion":" C. Social engineering is the best answer, as it can be useful to penetration testers who are asked to assess whether staff members are applying security training and have absorbed the awareness messages the organization uses. Port and vulnerability scanning find technical issues that may be related to awareness or training issues but that are less likely to be directly related. Discovery can involve port scanning or other data-gathering efforts but is also less likely to be directly related to training and awareness.\n"}
{"prompt":"Bill implemented RAID level 5 on a server that he operates using a total of three disks. How many disks may fail without the loss of data? A. 0 B. 1 C. 2 D. 3 ->","completion":" B.

{"prompt":"Mark is planning a disaster recovery test for his organization. He would like to perform a live test of the disaster recovery facility but does not want to disrupt operations at the primary facility. What type of test should Mark choose? A. Full interruption test B. Checklist review C. Parallel test D. Tabletop exercise ->","completion":" C. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is not a principle of the Agile approach to software development? A. The best architecture, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. B.

One of these principles is that the best architecture, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Another is that teams should welcome changing requirements at any step in the process. A third is that simplicity is essential. The Agile approach emphasizes delivering software frequently, not infrequently.\n"}
{"prompt":"During a security audit, Susan discovers that the organization is using hand geometry scanners as the access control mechanism for their secure data center. What recommendation should Susan make about the use of hand geometry scanners? A. They have a high FRR and should be replaced. B. A second factor should be added because they are not a good way to reliably distinguish individuals. C. The hand geometry scanners provide appropriate security for the data center and should be considered for other high-security areas. D. They may create accessibility concerns, and an alternate biometric system should be considered. ->","completion":" B. Hand geometry scanners assess the physical dimensions of an individual's hand but do not verify other unique factors about the individual, or even verify if they are alive. This means that hand geometry scanners should not be implemented as the sole authentication factor for secure environments. Hand geometry scanners do not have an abnormally high FRR and do not stand out as a particular issue from an accessibility standpoint compared to other biometric systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Colleen is conducting a business impact assessment for her organization. What metric provides important information about the amount of time that the organization may be without a service before causing irreparable harm? A. MTD B. ALE C. RPO D. RTO ->","completion":" A.

{"prompt":"If Alex hires a new employee and the employee's account is provisioned after HR manually inputs information into the provisioning system based on data Alex provides via a series of forms, what type of provisioning has occurred? A. Discretionary account provisioning B. Workflow-based account provisioning C. Automated account provisioning D. Self-service account provisioning ->","completion":" B. Provisioning that occurs through an established workflow, such as through an HR process, is workflow-based account provisioning. If Alex had set up accounts for his new hire on the systems he manages, he would have been using discretionary account provisioning. If the provisioning system allowed the new hire to sign up for an account on their own, they would have used self-service account provisioning, and if there was a central, software-driven process, rather than HR forms, it would have been automated account provisioning.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex has access to B, C, and D. What concern should he raise to the university's identity management team? A. The provisioning process did not give him the rights he needs. B. He has excessive privileges. C. Privilege creep may be taking place. D. Logging is not properly enabled. ->","completion":" C. As Alex has changed roles, he retained access to systems that he no longer administers. The provisioning system has provided rights to workstations and the application servers he manages, but he should not have access to the databases he no longer administers. Privilege levels are not specified, so we can't determine if he has excessive rights. Logging may or may not be enabled, but it isn't possible to tell from the diagram or problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Alex changes roles, what should occur? A. He should be de-provisioned and a new account should be created. B. He should have his new rights added to his existing account. C. He should be provisioned for only the rights that match his role. D. He should have his rights set to match those of the person he is replacing. ->","completion":" C. When a user's role changes, they should be provisioned based on their role and other access entitlements. De-provisioning and re-provisioning is time-consuming and can lead to problems with changed IDs and how existing credentials work. Simply adding new rights leads to privilege creep, and matching another user's rights can lead to excessive privileges due to privilege creep for that other user.\n"}

{"prompt":"Robert is the network administrator for a small business and recently installed a new firewall. After seeing signs of unusually heavy network traffic, he checked his intrusion detection system, which reported that a smurf attack was under way. What firewall configuration change can Robert make to most effectively prevent this attack? A. Block the source IP address of the attack. B. Block inbound UDP traffic. C. Block the destination IP address of the attack. D. Block inbound ICMP traffic. ->","completion":" D. Smurf attacks use a distributed attack approach to send ICMP echo replies at a targeted system from many different source addresses. The most effective way to block this attack would be to block inbound ICMP traffic. Blocking the source addresses is not feasible because the attacker would likely simply change the source addresses. Blocking destination addresses would likely disrupt normal activity. The smurf attack does not use UDP, so blocking that traffic would have no effect.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following types of firewalls does not have the ability to track connection status between different packets? A. Stateful inspection B. Application proxy C. Packet filter D. Next generation ->","completion":" C. Static packet filtering firewalls are known as first-generation firewalls and do not track connection state.

What type of solution should Kolin implement? A. A firewall B. A NAC system C. An intrusion detection system D. Port security ->","completion":" B. Network Access Control (NAC) systems can be used to authenticate users and then validate their system's compliance with a security standard before they are allowed to connect to the network. Enforcing security profiles can help reduce zero-day attacks, making NAC a useful solution. A firewall can't enforce system security policies, whereas an IDS can only monitor for attacks and alarm when they happen. Thus, neither a firewall nor an IDS meets Kolin's needs. Finally, port security is a MAC address鈥揵ased security feature that can only restrict which systems or devices can connect to a given port.\n"}
{"prompt":"Gwen comes across an application that is running under a service account on a web server. The service account has full administrative rights to the server. What principle of information security does this violate? A. Need to know B. Separation of duties C. Least privilege D. Job rotation ->","completion":" C.

{"prompt":"Why does Nikto flag the \/test directory? A. The \/test directory allows administrative access to PHP. B. It is used to store sensitive data. C. Test directories often contain scripts that can be misused. D. It indicates a potential compromise. ->","completion":" C. Test directories often include scripts that may have poor protections or may have other data that can be misused. There is not a default test directory that allows administrative access to PHP. Test directories are not commonly used to store sensitive data, nor is the existence of a test directory a common indicator of compromise.\n"}
{"prompt":"Why does Nikto identify directory indexing as an issue? A. It lists files in a directory. B. It may allow for XDRF. C. Directory indexing can result in a denial of service attack. D. Directory indexing is off by default, potentially indicating compromise. ->","completion":" A. Directory indexing may not initially seem like an issue during a penetration test, but simply knowing the name and location of files can provide an attacker with quite a bit of information about an organization, as well as a list of potentially accessible files. XDRF is not a type of attack, and indexing is not a denial of service attack vector. Directory indexing being turned on is typically either due to misconfiguration or design, or because the server was not properly configured at setup, rather than being a sign of attack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Nikto lists OSVDB-877, noting that the system may be vulnerable to XST. What would this type of attack allow an attacker to do? A. Use cross-site targeting. B. Steal a user's cookies. C. Counter SQL tracing. D. Modify a user's TRACE information. ->","completion":" B.

{"prompt":"Ursula believes that many individuals in her organization are storing sensitive information on their laptops in a manner that is unsafe and potentially violates the organization's security policy. What control can she use to identify the presence of these files? A. Network DLP B. Network IPS C. Endpoint DLP D. Endpoint IPS ->","completion":" C. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems specialize in the identification of sensitive information. In this case, Ursula would like to identify the presence of this information on endpoint devices, so she should choose an endpoint DLP control. Network-based DLP would not detect stored information unless the user transmits it over the network.

A bridge C. A gateway D. A router ->","completion":" D. Fred should choose a router. Routers are designed to control traffic on a network while connecting to other similar networks. If the networks are very different, a bridge can help connect them. Gateways are used to connect to networks that use other protocols by transforming traffic to the appropriate protocol or format as it passes through them. Switches are often used to create broadcast domains and to connect endpoint systems or other devices.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alex is preparing to solicit bids for a penetration test of his company's network and systems. He wants to maximize the effectiveness of the testing rather than the realism of the test. What type of penetration test should he require in his bidding process? A. Black box B. Crystal box C. Gray box D. Zero box ->","completion":" B. Crystal box penetration testing, which is also sometimes called white box penetration testing, provides the tester with information about networks, systems, and configurations, allowing highly effective testing. It doesn't simulate an actual attack like black and gray box testing can and thus does not have the same realism, and it can lead to attacks succeeding that would fail in a zero- or limited-knowledge attack.\n"}

Which of the following options will provide Jim with the best means of reliably identifying each unique device? A. Record the MAC address of each system. B. Require users to fill out a form to register each system. C. Scan each system using a port scanner. D. Use device fingerprinting via a web-based registration system. ->","completion":" D. Device fingerprinting via a web portal can require user authentication and can gather data like operating systems, versions, software information, and many other factors that can uniquely identify systems. Using an automated fingerprinting system is preferable to handling manual registration, and pairing user authentication with data gathering provides more detail than a port scan. MAC addresses can be spoofed, and systems may have more than one depending on how many network interfaces they have, which can make unique identification challenging.\n"}

Which one of the following controls would provide the greatest improvement in Gabe's ability to authenticate users? A. More complex passwords B. User education against social engineering C. Multifactor authentication D. Addition of security questions based on personal knowledge ->","completion":" C. While all of the listed controls would improve authentication security, most simply strengthen the use of knowledge-based authentication. The best way to improve the authentication process would be to add a factor not based on knowledge through the use of multifactor authentication. This may include the use of biometric controls or tokenbased authentication.\n"}
{"prompt":"The separation of network infrastructure from the control layer, combined with the ability to centrally program a network design in a vendor-neutral, standards-based implementation, is an example of what important concept? A. MPLS, a way to replace long network addresses with shorter labels and support a wide range of protocols B. FCoE, a converged protocol that allows common applications over Ethernet C. SDN, a converged protocol that allows network virtualization D. CDN, a converged protocol that makes common network designs accessible ->","completion":" C. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a converged protocol that allows virtualization concepts and practices to be applied to networks. MPLS handles a wide range of protocols like ATM, DSL, and others, but isn't intended to provide the centralization capabilities that SDN does. Content Distribution Network (CDN) is not a converged protocol, and FCoE is Fibre Channel over Ethernet, a converged protocol for storage.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan is preparing to decommission her organization's archival DVD-ROMs that contain Top Secret data. How should she ensure that the data cannot be exposed? A. Degauss B. Zero wipe C. Pulverize D. Secure erase ->","completion":" C. The best way to ensure that data on DVDs is fully gone is to destroy them, and pulverizing DVDs is an appropriate means of destruction. DVD-ROMs are write-only media, meaning that secure erase and zero wipes won't work. Degaussing only works on magnetic media and cannot guarantee that there will be zero data remanence.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the final stage of the Software Capability Maturity Model (SW-CMM)? A. Repeatable B. Defined C. Managed D. Optimizing ->","completion":" D.

What information security principle is she most directly enforcing? A. Separation of duties B. Two-person control C. Least privilege D. Job rotation ->","completion":" A. While developers may feel like they have a business need to be able to move code into production, the principle of separation of duties dictates that they should not have the ability to both write code and place it on a production server. The deployment of code is often performed by change management staff.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following tools may be used to achieve the goal of nonrepudiation? A. Digital signature B. Symmetric encryption C. Firewall D. IDS ->","completion":" A. Applying a digital signature to a message allows the sender to achieve the goal of nonrepudiation. This allows the recipient of a message to prove to a third party that the message came from the purported sender. Symmetric encryption does not support nonrepudiation. Firewalls and IDS are network security tools that are not used to provide nonrepudiation.\n"}
{"prompt":"In this diagram of the TCP three-way handshake, what should system A send to system B in step 3? A. ACK B. SYN C. FIN D. RST ->","completion":" A. System A should send an ACK to end the three-way handshake. The TCP three-way handshake is SYN, SYN\/ACK, ACK.\n"}
{"prompt":"What RADIUS alternative is commonly used for Cisco network gear and supports twofactor authentication? A. RADIUS+ B. TACACS+ C. XTACACS D. Kerberos ->","completion":" B. TACACS+ is the most modern version of TACACS, the Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System. It is a Cisco proprietary protocol with added features beyond what RADIUS provides, meaning it is commonly used on Cisco networks. XTACACS is an earlier version, Kerberos is a network authentication protocol rather than a remote user authentication protocol, and RADIUS+ is a made-up term.\n"}
{"prompt":"What two types of attacks are VoIP call managers and VoIP phones most likely to be susceptible to? A. DoS and malware B. Worms and Trojans C. DoS and host OS attacks D. Host OS attacks and buffer overflows ->","completion":" C. Call managers and VoIP phones can be thought of as servers or appliances and embedded or network devices. That means that the most likely threats that they will face are denial of service (DoS) attacks and attacks against the host operating system. Malware and Trojans are less likely to be effective against a server or embedded system that doesn't browse the Internet or exchange data files; buffer overflows are usually aimed at specific applications or services.\n"}
{"prompt":"Vivian works for a chain of retail stores and would like to use a software product that restricts the software used on point-of-sale terminals to those packages on a preapproved list. What approach should Vivian use? A. Antivirus B. Heuristic C. Whitelist D. Blacklist ->","completion":" C. The blacklist approach to application control blocks certain prohibited packages but allows the installation of other software on systems. The whitelist approach uses the reverse philosophy and only allows approved software. Antivirus software would only detect the installation of malicious software after the fact. Heuristic detection is a variant of antivirus software.\n"}
{"prompt":"Based on the information in this scenario, what is the exposure factor for the effect of a flood on DataTech's data center? A. 2% B. 20% C. 100% D. 200% ->","completion":" B. The exposure factor is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. In this case, that is $20 million in damage divided by the $100 million facility value, or 20%.\n"}

A. $40,000 B. $100,000 C. $400,000 D. $1,000,000 ->","completion":" B. The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $20 million and the ARO is 0.005. Multiplying these numbers together gives you the ALE of $100,000.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which accounts are typically assessed during an account management assessment? A. A random sample B. Highly privileged accounts C. Recently generated accounts D. Accounts that have existed for long periods of time ->","completion":" B. The most frequent target of account management reviews are highly privileged accounts, as they create the greatest risk. Random samples are the second most likely choice. Accounts that have existed for a longer period of time are more likely to have a problem due to privilege creep than recently created accounts, but neither of these choices is likely unless there is a specific organizational reason to choose them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Cloud computing uses a shared responsibility model for security, where the vendor and customer each bear some responsibility for security. The division of responsibility depends upon the type of service used. Place the cloud service offerings listed here in order from the case where the customer bears the least responsibility to where the customer bears the most responsibility. A. IaaS B. SaaS C. PaaS D. TaaS ->","completion":" The cloud service offerings in order from the case where the customer bears the least responsibility to where the customer bears the most responsibility are B. SaaS C. PaaS A. IaaS In an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud computing model, the customer retains responsibility for managing operating system and application security while the vendor manages security at the hypervisor level and below. In a platform as a service (PaaS) environment, the vendor takes on responsibility for the operating system, but the customer writes and configures any applications. In a software as a service (SaaS) environment, the vendor takes on responsibility for the development and implementation of the application while the customer merely configures security settings within the application. TaaS is not a cloud service model.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of error occurs when a valid subject using a biometric authenticator is not authenticated? A. A Type 1 error B. A Type 2 error C. A Type 3 error D.

What rule of evidence requires George's testimony? A. Testimonial evidence rule B. Parol evidence rule C. Best evidence rule D. Hearsay rule ->","completion":" D. The hearsay rule says that a witness cannot testify about what someone else told them, except under very specific exceptions. The courts have applied the hearsay rule to include the concept that attorneys may not introduce logs into evidence unless they are authenticated by the system administrator. The best evidence rule states that copies of documents may not be submitted into evidence if the originals are available. The parol evidence rule states that if two parties enter into a written agreement, that written document is assumed to contain all of the terms of the agreement. Testimonial evidence is a type of evidence, not a rule of evidence.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following is not a valid use for key risk indicators? A. Provide warnings before issues occur. B. Provide real-time incident response information. C. Provide historical views of past risks. D. Provide insight into risk tolerance for the organization. ->","completion":" B. While key risk indicators can provide useful information for organizational planning and a deeper understanding of how organizations view risk, KRIs are not a great way to handle a real-time security response. Monitoring and detection systems like IPS, SIEM, and other tools are better suited to handling actual attacks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following malware types uses built-in propagation mechanisms that exploit system vulnerabilities to spread? A. Trojan horse B. Worm C. Logic bomb D. Virus ->","completion":" B. Worms have built-in propagation mechanisms that do not require user interaction, such as scanning for systems containing known vulnerabilities and then exploiting those vulnerabilities to gain access. Viruses and Trojan horses typically require user interaction to spread. Logic bombs do not spread from system to system but lie in wait until certain conditions are met, triggering the delivery of their payload.\n"}

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates the protection of protected health information (PHI). The SAFE Act deals with mortgages, the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) covers financial institutions, and FERPA deals with student data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following techniques can an attacker use to exploit a TOC\/TOU vulnerability? A. File locking B. Exception handling C. Algorithmic complexity D. Concurrency control ->","completion":" C. Attackers may use algorithmic complexity as a tool to exploit a TOC\/TOU race condition. By varying the workload on the CPU, attackers may exploit the amount of time required to process requests and use that variance to effectively schedule the exploit's execution. File locking, exception handling, and concurrency controls are all methods used to defend against TOC\/TOU attacks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan is configuring her network devices to use syslog. What should she set to ensure that she is notified about issues but does not receive normal operational issue messages? A. The facility code B. The log priority C. The security level D. The severity level ->","completion":" D. Implementations of syslog vary, but most provide a setting for severity level, allowing configuration of a value that determines what messages are sent. Typical severity levels include debug, informational, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, and emergency. The facility code is also supported by syslog, but is associated with which services are being logged. Security level and log priority are not typical syslog settings.\n"}
{"prompt":"What RAID level is also known as disk mirroring? A. RAID 0 B. RAID 1 C. RAID 3 D. RAID 5 ->","completion":" B. In RAID 1, also known as disk mirroring, systems contain two physical disks.

What legal tool should they use to help protect their data if he chooses to leave to work at a competitor? A. A stop-loss order B. An NDA C. An AUP D. Encryption ->","completion":" B. A nondisclosure agreement (NDA) is a legal agreement between two parties that specifies what data they will not disclose. NDAs are common in industries that have sensitive or trade secret information they do not want employees to take to new jobs. Encryption would only help in transit or at rest, and Fred will likely have access to the data in unencrypted form as part of his job. An AUP is an acceptable use policy, and a stop-loss order is used on the stock market.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following computing models allows the execution of multiple processes on a single processor by having the operating system switch between them without requiring modification to the applications? A. Multitasking B. Multiprocessing C. Multiprogramming D. Multithreading ->","completion":" A.

{"prompt":"Ben's job is to ensure that data is labeled with the appropriate sensitivity label. Since Ben works for the US government, he has to apply the labels Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret to systems and media. If Ben is asked to label a system that handles Secret, Confidential, and Unclassified information, how should he label it? A. Mixed classification B. Confidential C. Top Secret D. Secret ->","completion":" D. Systems and media should be labeled with the highest level of sensitivity that they store or handle. In this case, based on the US government classification scheme, the highest classification level in use on the system is Secret. Mixed classification provides no useful information about the level, whereas Top Secret and Confidential are too high and too low, respectively.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan has discovered that the smart card-based locks used to keep the facility she works at secure are not effective because staff members are propping the doors open. She places signs on the doors reminding staff that leaving the door open creates a security issue, and she adds alarms that will sound if the doors are left open for more than five minutes. What type of controls has she put into place? A. Physical B. Administrative C. Compensation D. Recovery ->","completion":" C. She has placed compensation controls in place. Compensation controls are used when controls like the locks in this example are not sufficient. While the alarm is a physical control, the signs she posted are not. Similarly, the alarms are not administrative controls. None of these controls help to recover from an issue and are thus not recovery controls.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben is concerned about password cracking attacks against his system. He would like to implement controls that prevent an attacker who has obtained those hashes from easily cracking them. What two controls would best meet this objective? A. Longer passwords and salting B. Over-the-wire encryption and use of SHA1 instead of MD5 C. Salting and use of MD5 D. Using shadow passwords and salting ->","completion":" A. Rainbow tables rely on being able to use databases of precomputed hashes to quickly search for matches to known hashes acquired by an attacker. Making passwords longer can greatly increase the size of the rainbow table required to find the matching hash, and adding a salt to the password will make it nearly impossible for the attacker to generate a table that will match unless they can acquire the salt value. MD5 and SHA1 are both poor choices for password hashing compared to modern password hashes, which are designed to make hashing easy and recovery difficult. Rainbow tables are often used against lists of hashes acquired by attacks rather than over-the-wire attacks, so over-the-wire encryption is not particularly useful here. Shadow passwords simply make the traditionally worldreadable list of password hashes on Unix and Linux systems available in a location readable only by root. This doesn't prevent a rainbow table attack once the hashes are obtained.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which group is best suited to evaluate and report on the effectiveness of administrative controls an organization has put in place to a third party? A. Internal auditors B. Penetration testers C. External auditors D. Employees who design, implement, and monitor the controls ->","completion":" C. External auditors can provide an unbiased and impartial view of an organization's controls to third parties. Internal auditors are useful when reporting to senior management of the organization but are typically not asked to report to third parties. Penetration tests test technical controls but are not as well suited to testing many administrative controls. The employees who build and maintain controls are more likely to bring a bias to the testing of those controls and should not be asked to report on them to third parties.\n"}
{"prompt":"Renee is using encryption to safeguard sensitive business secrets when in transit over the Internet. What risk metric is she attempting to lower? A. Likelihood B. RTO C. MTO D. Impact ->","completion":" A. Using encryption reduces risk by lowering the likelihood that an eavesdropper will be able to gain access to sensitive information.\n"}

Relocating the data center to a safer area C. Documenting the decision-making process D. Reengineering the facility to withstand the shock of an earthquake ->","completion":" C. In a risk acceptance strategy, the organization chooses to take no action other than documenting the risk. Purchasing insurance would be an example of risk transference. Relocating the data center would be risk avoidance. Reengineering the facility is an example of a risk mitigation strategy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Carol would like to implement a control that protects her organization from the momentary loss of power to the data center. Which control is most appropriate for her needs? A. Redundant servers B. RAID C. UPS D. Generator ->","completion":" C. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) provide immediate, battery-driven power for a short period of time to cover momentary losses of power. Generators are capable of providing backup power for a sustained period of time in the event of a power loss, but they take time to activate. RAID and redundant servers are high-availability controls but do not cover power loss scenarios.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben has encountered problems with users in his organization reusing passwords, despite a requirement that they change passwords every 30 days. What type of password setting should Ben employ to help prevent this issue? A. Longer minimum age B. Increased password complexity C. Implement password history D. Implement password length requirements ->","completion":" C. Password histories retain a list of previous passwords, preferably a list of salted hashes for previous passwords, to ensure that users don't reuse their previous passwords. Longer minimum age can help prevent users from changing their passwords and then changing them back but won't prevent a determined user from eventually getting their old password back. Length requirements and complexity requirements tend to drive users to reuse passwords if they're not paired with tools like single sign-on, password storage systems, or other tools that decrease the difficulty of password management.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris is conducting a risk assessment for his organization and has determined the amount of damage that a single flood could be expected to cause to his facilities. What metric has Chris identified? A. ALE B. SLE C. ARO D. AV ->","completion":" B. The Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is the amount of damage that a risk is expected to cause each time that it occurs.\n"}
{"prompt":"The removal of a hard drive from a PC before it is retired and sold as surplus is an example of what type of action? A. Purging B. Sanitization C. Degaussing D. Destruction ->","completion":" B. Sanitization includes steps like removing the hard drive and other local storage from PCs before they are sold as surplus. Degaussing uses magnetic fields to wipe media; purging is an intense form of clearing used to ensure that data is removed and unrecoverable from media; and removing does not necessarily imply destruction of the drive.\n"}
{"prompt":"During which phase of the incident response process would an organization determine whether it is required to notify law enforcement officials or other regulators of the incident? A. Detection B. Recovery C. Remediation D. Reporting ->","completion":" D. During the Reporting phase, incident responders assess their obligations under laws and regulations to report the incident to government agencies and other regulators.\n"}
{"prompt":"What OASIS standard markup language is used to generate provisioning requests both within organizations and with third parties? A. SAML B. SPML C. XACML D. SOA ->","completion":" B. Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) is an OASIS developed markup language designed to provide service, user, and resource provisioning between organizations. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used to exchange user authentication and authorization data. Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is used to describe access controls. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is not a markup language.\n"}
{"prompt":"Michelle is in charge of her organization's mobile device management efforts and handles lost and stolen devices. Which of the following recommendations will provide the most assurance to her organization that data will not be lost if a device is stolen? A. Mandatory passcodes and application management B. Full device encryption and mandatory passcodes C. Remote wipe and GPS tracking D. Enabling GPS tracking and full device encryption ->","completion":" B. While full device encryption doesn't guarantee that data cannot be accessed, it provides Michelle's best option for preventing data from being lost with a stolen device when paired with a passcode. Mandatory passcodes and application management can help prevent application-based attacks and unwanted access to devices, but won't keep the data secure if the device is lost. Remote wipe and GPS location is useful if the thief allows the device to connect to a cellular or Wi-Fi network. Unfortunately, many modern thieves immediately take steps to ensure that the device will not be trackable or allowed to connect to a network before they capture data or wipe the device for resale.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan's SMTP server does not authenticate senders before accepting and relaying email. What is this security configuration issue known as? A. An email gateway B. An SMTP relay C. An X.400-compliant gateway D. An open relay ->","completion":" D. SMTP servers that don't authenticate users before relaying their messages are known as open relays. Open relays that are Internet exposed are typically quickly exploited to send email for spammers.\n"}
{"prompt":"When the breach was discovered and the logs were reviewed, it was discovered that the attacker had purged the logs on the system that they compromised. How can this be prevented in the future? A. Encrypt local logs B. Require administrative access to change logs C. Enable log rotation D. Send logs to a bastion host ->","completion":" D. Sending logs to a secure log server, sometimes called a bastion host, is the most effective way to ensure that logs survive a breach. Encrypting local logs won't stop an attacker from deleting them, and requiring administrative access won't stop attackers who have breached a machine and acquired escalated privileges. Log rotation archives logs based on time or file size, and can also purge logs after a threshold is hit. Rotation won't prevent an attacker from purging logs.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can Jack detect issues like this using his organization's new centralized logging? A. Deploy and use an IDS B. Send logs to a central logging server C. Deploy and use a SIEM D. Use syslog ->","completion":" C. A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool is designed to provide automated analysis and monitoring of logs and security events. A SIEM tool that receives access to logs can help detect and alert on events like logs being purged or other breach indicators. An IDS can help detect intrusions, but IDSs are not typically designed to handle central logs. A central logging server can receive and store logs but won't help with analysis without taking additional actions. Syslog is simply a log format.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can Jack best ensure accountability for actions taken on systems in his environment? A. Log review and require digital signatures for each log. B. Require authentication for all actions taken and capture logs centrally. C. Log the use of administrative credentials and encrypt log data in transit. D. Require authorization and capture logs centrally. ->","completion":" B. Requiring authentication can help provide accountability by ensuring that any action taken can be tracked back to a specific user. Storing logs centrally ensures that users can't erase the evidence of actions that they have taken. Log review can be useful when identifying issues, but digital signatures are not a typical part of a logging environment. Logging the use of administrative credentials helps for those users but won't cover all users, and encrypting the logs doesn't help with accountability. Authorization helps, but being able to specifically identify users through authentication is more important.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ed's organization has 5 IP addresses allocated to them by their ISP but needs to connect over 100 computers and network devices to the Internet. What technology can he use to connect his entire network via the limited set of IP addresses he can use? A. IPsec B. PAT C. SDN D. IPX ->","completion":" B. Port Address Translation (PAT) is used to allow a network to use any IP address set inside without causing a conflict with the public Internet. PAT is often confused with Network Address Translation (NAT), which maps one internal address to one external address. IPsec is a security protocol suite, software-defined networking (SDN) is a method of defining networks programmatically, and IPX is a non-IP network protocol.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of attack would the following precautions help prevent? -Requesting proof of identity -Requiring callback authorizations on voice-only requests -Not changing passwords via voice communications A. DoS attacks B. Worms C. Social engineering D. Shoulder surfing ->","completion":" C. Each of the precautions listed helps to prevent social engineering by helping prevent exploitation of trust. Avoiding voice-only communications is particularly important, since establishing identity over the phone is difficult. The other listed attacks would not be prevented by these techniques.\n"}
{"prompt":"Fred's organization needs to use a non-IP protocol on their VPN. Which of the common VPN protocols should he select to natively handle non-IP protocols? A. PPTP B. L2F C. L2TP D. IPsec ->","completion":" C. L2TP is the only one of the four common VPN protocols that can natively support non-IP protocols. PPTP, L2F, and IPsec are all IP-only protocols.\n"}
{"prompt":"Residual data is another term for what type of data left after attempts have been made to erase it? A. Leftover data B. MBR C. Bitrot D. Remnant data ->","completion":" D. Remnant data is data that is left after attempts have been made to remove or erase it. Bitrot is a term used to describe aging media that decays over time. MBR is the master boot record, a boot sector found on hard drives and other media. Leftover data is not an industry term.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following disaster recovery test types involves the actual activation of the disaster recovery facility? A. Simulation test B. Tabletop exercise C. Parallel test D. Checklist review ->","completion":" C. During a parallel test, the team activates the disaster recovery site for testing but the primary site remains operational. A simulation test involves a roleplay of a prepared scenario overseen by a moderator. Responses are assessed to help improve the organization's response process. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"What access control system lets owners decide who has access to the objects they own? A. Role-based access control B. Task-based access control C. Discretionary access control D. Rule-based access control ->","completion":" C. Discretionary access control gives owners the right to decide who has access to the objects they own. Role-based access control uses administrators to make that decision for roles or groups of people with a role, task-based access control uses lists of tasks for each user, and rule-based access control applies a set of rules to all subjects.\n"}
{"prompt":"Using a trusted channel and link encryption are both ways to prevent what type of access control attack? A. Brute force B. Spoofed login screens C. Man-in-the-middle attacks D. Dictionary attacks ->","completion":" C. Trusted paths that secure network traffic from capture and link encryption are both ways to help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Brute-force and dictionary attacks can both be prevented using back-off algorithms that slow down repeated attacks. Log analysis tools can also create dynamic firewall rules, or an IPS can block attacks like these in real time. Spoofed login screens can be difficult to prevent, although user awareness training can help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is not one of the canons of the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics? A. Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure. B. Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally. C. Provide diligent and competent service to principals. D. Maintain competent records of all investigations and assessments. ->","completion":" D. The four canons of the (ISC)2 code of ethics are to protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure; act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally; provide diligent and competent service to principals; and advance and protect the profession.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following components should be included in an organization's emergency response guidelines? A. Immediate response procedures B. Long-term business continuity protocols C. Activation procedures for the organization's cold sites D. Contact information for ordering equipment ->","completion":" A. The emergency response guidelines should include the immediate steps an organization should follow in response to an emergency situation. These include immediate response procedures, a list of individuals who should be notified of the emergency, and secondary response procedures for first responders. They do not include long-term actions such as activating business continuity protocols, ordering equipment, or activating DR sites.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben is working on integrating a federated identity management system and needs to exchange authentication and authorization information for browser-based single sign-on. What technology is his best option? A. HTML B. XACML C. SAML D. SPML ->","completion":" C. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is the best choice for providing authentication and authorization information, particularly for browser-based SSO. HTML is primarily used for web pages, SPML is used to exchange user information for SSO, and XACML is used for access control policy markup.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the minimum interval at which an organization should conduct business continuity plan refresher training for those with specific business continuity roles? A. Weekly B. Monthly C.

{"prompt":"What is the minimum number of cryptographic keys necessary to achieve strong security when using the 3DES algorithm? A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 4 ->","completion":" B. Triple DES functions by using either two or three encryption keys. When used with only one key, 3DES produces weakly encrypted ciphertext that is the insecure equivalent of DES.\n"}
{"prompt":"Match each of the numbered IP addresses with the best lettered description of that IP address. Each IP address in the numbered list should have one answer from the descriptions. Each description may be used once, more than once, or not at all. IP address 10.14.124.240 127.0.0.1 129.74.250.100 169.254.103.17 192.168.15.10 216.15.1.10 Description A. Public IP address B. Private IP address C. APIPA address D. Loopback address ->","completion":" The IP addresses match with the descriptions as follows: 10.14.124.240: B. Private IP address. 127.0.0.1: D. Loopback address. 129.74.250.100: A. Public IP address. 169.254.103.17: C. APIPA address. 192.168.15.10: B. Private IP address. 216.15.1.10: A. Public IP address. Private (RFC 1918) addresses are in the range 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. APIPA addresses are assigned between 169.254.0.01 and 169.254.255.254, and 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address (although technically the entire 127.x.x.x network is reserved for loopback). Public IP addresses are the rest of the addresses in the space.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lauren wants to monitor her LDAP servers to identify what types of queries are causing problems. What type of monitoring should she use if she wants to be able to use the production servers and actual traffic for her testing? A. Active B. Real-time C. Passive D. Replay ->","completion":" C. Since Lauren wants to monitor her production server, she should use passive monitoring by employing a network tap, span port, or other means of copying actual traffic to a monitoring system that can identify performance and other problems. This will avoid introducing potentially problematic traffic on purpose while capturing actual traffic problems. Active monitoring relies on synthetic or previously recorded traffic, and both replay and real time are not common industry terms used to describe types of monitoring.\n"}
{"prompt":"Steve is developing an input validation routine that will protect the database supporting a web application from SQL injection attack. Where should Steve place the input validation code? A. JavaScript embedded in the web pages B. Backend code on the web server C. Stored procedure on the database D. Code on the user's web browser ->","completion":" B. For web applications, input validation should always be performed on the web application server. By the time the input reaches the database, it is already part of a SQL command that is properly formatted and input validation would be far more difficult, if it is even possible. Input validation controls should never reside in the client's browser, as is the case with JavaScript, because the user may remove or tamper with the validation code.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben is selecting an encryption algorithm for use in an organization with 10,000 employees. He must facilitate communication between any two employees within the organization. Which one of the following algorithms would allow him to meet this goal with the least time dedicated to key management? A. RSA B. IDEA C. 3DES D. Skipjack ->","completion":" A. RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that requires only two keys for each user. IDEA, 3DES, and Skipjack are all symmetric encryption algorithms and would require a key for every unique pair of users in the system.\n"}

{"prompt":"Which one of the following activities transforms a zero-day vulnerability into a less dangerous attack vector? A. Discovery of the vulnerability B. Implementation of transport-layer encryption C. Reconfiguration of a firewall D. Release of a security patch ->","completion":" D. Zero-day vulnerabilities remain in the dangerous zero-day category until the release of a patch that corrects the vulnerability. At that time, it becomes the responsibility of IT professionals to protect their systems by applying the patch. Implementation of other security controls, such as encryption or firewalls, does not change the nature of the zeroday vulnerability.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is an example of a hardening provision that might strengthen an organization's existing physical facilities and avoid implementation of a business continuity plan? A. Patching a leaky roof B. Reviewing and updating firewall access control lists C. Upgrading operating systems D. Deploying a network intrusion detection system ->","completion":" A. All of the techniques listed are hardening methods, but only patching the leaky roof is an example of physical infrastructure hardening.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan wants to monitor traffic between systems in a VMWare environment. What solution would be her best option to monitor that traffic? A. Use a traditional hardware-based IPS. B. Install Wireshark on each virtual system. C. Set up a virtual span port and capture data using a VM IDS. D. Use netcat to capture all traffic sent between VMs. ->","completion":" C. Using a virtual machine to monitor a virtual span port allows the same type of visibility that it would in a physical network if implemented properly. Installing Wireshark would allow monitoring on each system but doesn't scale well. A physical appliance would require all traffic to be sent out of the VM environment, losing many of the benefits of the design. Finally, netcat is a network tool used to send or receive data, but it isn't a tool that allows packet capture of traffic between systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Matthew sends Richard a message, what key should he use to encrypt the message? A. Matthew's public key B. Matthew's private key C. Richard's public key D. Richard's private key ->","completion":" C. The sender of a message encrypts the message using the public key of the message recipient.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Richard receives the message from Matthew, what key should he use to decrypt the message? A. Matthew's public key B. Matthew's private key C. Richard's public key D. Richard's private key ->","completion":" D. The recipient of a message uses his or her own private key to decrypt messages that were encrypted with the recipient's public key. This ensures that nobody other than the intended recipient can decrypt the message.\n"}
{"prompt":"Matthew would like to enhance the security of his communication by adding a digital signature to the message. What goal of cryptography are digital signatures intended to enforce? A. Secrecy B. Availability C. Confidentiality D. Nonrepudiation ->","completion":" D. Digital signatures enforce nonrepudiation. They prevent an individual from denying that he or she was the actual originator of the message.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Matthew goes to add the digital signature to the message, what encryption key does he use to create the digital signature? A. Matthew's public key B. Matthew's private key C. Richard's public key D. Richard's private key ->","completion":" B. An individual creates a digital signature by encrypting the message digest with his or her own private key.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Jim logs into a system, his password is compared to a hashed value stored in a database. What is this process? A. Identification B. Hashing C. Tokenization D. Authentication ->","completion":" D. The comparison of a factor to validate an identity is known as authentication. Identification would occur when Jim presented his user ID. Tokenization is a process that converts a sensitive data element to a nonsensitive representation of that element. Hashing transforms a string of characters into a fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the primary advantage of decentralized access control? A. It provides better redundancy. B. It provides control of access to people closer to the resources. C. It is less expensive. D. It provides more granular control of access. ->","completion":" B. Decentralized access control empowers people closer to the resources to control access but does not provide consistent control. It does not provide redundancy, since it merely moves control points, the cost of access control depends on its implementation and methods, and granularity can be achieved in both centralized and decentralized models.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following types of controls does not describe a mantrap? A. Deterrent B. Preventive C. Compensating D. Physical ->","completion":" C. A mantrap, which is composed of a pair of doors with an access mechanism that allows only one door to open at a time, is an example of a preventive access control because it can stop unwanted access by keeping intruders from accessing a facility due to an opened door or following legitimate staff in. It can serve as a deterrent by discouraging intruders who would be trapped in it without proper access, and of course, doors with locks are an example of a physical control. A compensating control attempts to make up for problems with an existing control or to add additional controls to improve a primary control.\n"}
{"prompt":"Sally's organization needs to be able to prove that certain staff members sent emails, and she wants to adopt a technology that will provide that capability without changing their existing email system. What is the technical term for the capability Sally needs to implement as the owner of the email system, and what tool could she use to do it? A. Integrity;IMAP B. Repudiation;encryption C. Nonrepudiation;digital signatures D. Authentication;DKIM ->","completion":" C. Sally needs to provide nonrepudiation, the ability to provably associate a given email with a sender. Digital signatures can provide nonrepudiation and are her best option. IMAP is a mail protocol, encryption can provide confidentiality, and DKIM is a tool for identifying domains that send email.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following background checks is not normally performed during normal pre-hire activities? A. Credit check B. Reference verification C. Criminal records check D. Medical records check ->","completion":" D. In most situations, employers may not access medical information due to healthcare privacy laws. Reference checks, criminal records checks, and credit history reports are all typically found during pre-employment background checks.\n"}

Which of the following technologies is her best choice? A. RADIUS B. LDAP C. Kerberos D. Active Directory ->","completion":" B. Kathleen's needs point to a directory service, and the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) would meet her needs. LDAP is an open, industry-standard, and vendorneutral protocol for directory services. Kerberos and RADIUS are both authentication protocols, and Active Directory is a Microsoft product and is not vendor neutral, although it does support a number of open standards.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of firewall is capable of inspecting traffic at layer 7 and performing protocolspecific analysis for malicious traffic? A. Application firewall B. Stateful inspection firewall C. Packet filtering firewall D. Bastion host ->","completion":" A. Application firewalls add layer 7 functionality to other firewall solutions.

Which one of the rules in the Take-Grant protection model would allow her to complete this operation? A. Take rule B. Grant rule C. Create rule D. Remove rule ->","completion":" C. The create rule allows a subject to create new objects and also creates an edge from the subject to that object, granting rights on the new object.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which of the following concerns should not be on Lauren's list of potential issues when penetration testers suggest using Metasploit during their testing? A. Metasploit can only test vulnerabilities it has plug-ins for. B. Penetration testing only covers a point-in-time view of the organization's security. C. Tools like Metasploit can cause denial of service issues. D. Penetration testing cannot test process and policy. ->","completion":" A. Metasploit provides an extensible framework, allowing penetration testers to create their own exploits in addition to those that are built into the tool. Unfortunately, penetration testing can only cover the point in time when it is conducted. When conducting a penetration test, the potential to cause a denial of service due to a fragile service always exists, but it can test process and policy through social engineering and operational testing that validates how those processes and policies work.\n"}

{"prompt":"Tracy recently accepted an IT compliance position at a federal government agency that works very closely with the Defense Department on classified government matters. Which one of the following laws is least likely to pertain to Tracy's agency? A. HIPAA B. FISMA C. HSA D. CFAA ->","completion":" A. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies to healthcare information and is unlikely to apply in this situation. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and Government Information Security Reform Act regulate the activities of all government agencies. The Homeland Security Act (HSA) created the US Department of Homeland Security, and more importantly for this question included the Cyber Security Enhancement Act of 2002 and the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) provides specific protections for systems operated by government agencies.\n"}
{"prompt":"Referring to the figure shown here, what is the name of the security control indicated by the arrow? A. Mantrap B. Intrusion prevention system C. Turnstile D. Portal ->","completion":" C. Turnstiles are unidirectional gates that prevent more than a single person from entering a facility at a time.\n"}
{"prompt":"What two important factors does accountability for access control rely on? A. Identification and authorization B. Authentication and authorization C. Identification and authentication D. Accountability and authentication ->","completion":" C. Access control systems rely on identification and authentication to provide accountability. Effective authorization systems are desirable, but not required, since logs can provide information about who accessed what resources, even if access to those resources is not managed well. Of course, poor authorization management can create many other problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"What key assumption made by EAP can be remedied by using PEAP? A. EAP assumes that LEAP will replace TKIP, ensuring that authentication will occur. B. EAP originally assumed the use of physically isolated channels and is usually not encrypted. C. There are no TLS implementations available using EAP. D. EAP does not allow additional authentication methods, and PEAP adds additional methods. ->","completion":" B. EAP was originally intended to be used on physically isolated network channels and did not include encryption. Fortunately, it was designed to be extensible, and PEAP can provide TLS encryption. EAP isn't limited to PEAP as an option as EAP-TLS also exists, providing an EAP TLS implementation, and the same extensibility allows a multitude of other authentication methods.\n"}

{"prompt":"Jennifer needs to measure the effectiveness of her information security program as she works toward her organization's long-term goals. What type of measures should she select? A. Metrics B. KPIs C. SLAs D. OKRs ->","completion":" B. She should use a KPI (Key Performance Indicator). KPIs are used to measure success, typically in relation to an organization's long-term goals. Metrics are measures, and although a KPI can be a metric, metrics are not all KPIs. SLAs are service level agreements, and metrics can help determine whether they are being met. Objectives and key results (OKRs) are used to connect employee performance to results using subjective measures for objectives and quantitative measures for key results.\n"}
{"prompt":"Sue's organization recently failed a security assessment because their network was a single flat broadcast domain, and sniffing traffic was possible between different functional groups. What solution should she recommend to help prevent the issues that were identified? A. Use VLANs. B. Change the subnet mask for all systems. C. Deploy gateways. D. Turn on port security. ->","completion":" A. A well-designed set of VLANs based on functional groupings will logically separate segments of the network, making it difficult to have data exposure issues between VLANs. Changing the subnet mask will only modify the broadcast domain and will not fix issues with packet sniffing. Gateways would be appropriate if network protocols were different on different segments. Port security is designed to limit which systems can connect to a given port.\n"}
{"prompt":"Fred's data role requires him to maintain system security plans and to ensure that system users and support staff get the training they need about security practices and acceptable use. What is the role that Fred is most likely to hold in the organization? A. Data owner B. System owner C. User D. Custodian ->","completion":" B. NIST SP 800-18 describes system owner responsibilities that include helping to develop system security plans, maintaining the plan, ensuring training, and identifying, implementing, and assessing security controls. A data owner is more likely to delegate these tasks to the system owner. Custodians may be asked to enforce those controls, whereas a user will be directly affected by them.\n"}

{"prompt":"Ben wants to provide predictive information about his organization's risk exposure in an automated way as part of an ongoing organizational risk management plan. What should he use to do this? A. KRIs B. Quantitative risk assessments C. KPIs D. Penetration tests ->","completion":" A. Key risk indicators (KRIs) are often used to monitor risk for organizations that establish an ongoing risk management program. Using automated data gathering and tools that allow data to be digested and summarized can provide predictive information about how organizational risks are changing. KPIs are key performance indicators, which are used to assess how an organization is performing. Quantitative risk assessments are good for point-in-time views with detailed valuation and measurement-based risk assessments, whereas a penetration test would provide details of how well an organization's security controls are working.\n"}

{"prompt":"Chris is conducting reconnaissance on a remote target and discovers that pings are allowed through his target's border firewall. What can he learn by using ping to probe the remote network? A. Which systems respond to ping, a rough network topology, and potentially the location of additional firewalls B. A list of all of the systems behind the target's firewall C. The hostnames and time to live (TTL) for each pingable system, and the ICMP types allowed through the firewall D. Router advertisements, echo request responses, and potentially which hosts are tarpitted ->","completion":" A. Systems that respond to ping will show the time to live for packets that reach them. Since TTL is decremented at each hop, this can help build a rough network topology map. In addition, some firewalls respond differently to ping than a normal system, which means pinging a network can sometimes reveal the presence of firewalls that would otherwise be invisible. Hostnames are revealed by a DNS lookup, and ICMP types allowed through a firewall are not revealed by only performing a ping. ICMP can be used for router advertisements, but pinging won't show them!\n"}
{"prompt":"What access management concept defines what rights or privileges a user has? A. Identification B. Accountability C. Authorization D. Authentication ->","completion":" C. Authorization defines what a subject can or can't do. Identification occurs when a subject claims an identity, accountability is provided by the logs and audit trail that track what occurs on a system, and authorization occurs when that identity is validated.\n"}

What issue is likely to show up during an account review if her organization does not have strong account maintenance practices? A. An issue with least privilege B. Privilege creep C. Account creep D. Account termination ->","completion":" B. Privilege creep is a common problem when employees change roles over time and their privileges and permissions are not properly modified to reflect their new roles. Least privilege issues are a design or implementation problem, and switching roles isn't typically what causes them to occur. Account creep is not a common industry term, and account termination would imply that someone has removed her account instead of switching her to new groups or new roles.\n"}
{"prompt":"IP addresses like 10.10.10.10 and 172.19.24.21 are both examples of what type of IP address? A. Public IP addresses B. Prohibited IP addresses C. Private IP addresses D.

Cognitive passwords require users to think to answer the question, and not all users may be able to solve the problems presented. D. Cognitive passwords don't support long passwords. ->","completion":" B. A cognitive password authenticates users based on a series of facts or answers to questions that they know. Preset questions for cognitive passwords typically rely on common information about a user like their mother's maiden name or the name of their pet, and that information can frequently be found on the Internet. The best cognitive password systems let users make up their own questions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Megan needs to create a forensic copy of a hard drive that will be used in an investigation. Which of the following tools is best suited to her work? A. xcopy B. dd C. DBAN D. ImageMagik ->","completion":" B. The Linux tool dd creates a bit-by-bit copy of the target drive that is well suited to forensic use, and special forensic versions of dd exist that can provide even more forensic features. Simply copying files using a tool like xcopy does not create a forensically sound copy. DBAN is a drive wiping tool and would cause Megan to lose the data she is seeking to copy. ImageMagik is a graphics manipulation and editing program.\n"}

What is the best type of access control design for Jack's organization? A. Centralized access control B. Mandatory access control C. Decentralized access control D. Rule-based access control ->","completion":" C. Decentralized access control makes sense because it allows local control over access. When network connectivity to a central control point is a problem or if rules and regulations may vary significantly from location to location, centralized control can be less desirable than decentralized control despite its challenges with consistency. Since the problem does not describe specific control needs, mandatory access control and rule-based access controls could fit the need but aren't the best answer.\n"}

{"prompt":"Which one of the following tools may be used to directly violate the confidentiality of communications on an unencrypted VoIP network? A. Nmap B. Nessus C. Wireshark D. Nikto ->","completion":" C. Wireshark is a network monitoring tool that can capture and replay communications sent over a data network, including Voice over IP (VoIP) communications. Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto are all security tools that may identify security flaws in the network, but they do not directly undermine confidentiality because they do not have the ability to capture communications.\n"}
{"prompt":"How does single sign-on increase security? A. It decreases the number of accounts required for a subject. B. It helps decrease the likelihood that users will write down their passwords. C. It provides logging for each system that it is connected to. D. It provides better encryption for authentication data. ->","completion":" B. Studies consistently show that users are more likely to write down passwords if they have more accounts. Central control of a single account is also easier to shut off if something does go wrong. Simply decreasing the number of accounts required for a subject doesn't increase security by itself, and SSO does not guarantee individual system logging, although it should provide central logging of SSO activity. Since an SSO system was not specified, there is no way of determining whether a given SSO system provides better or worse encryption for authentication data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following cryptographic algorithms supports the goal of nonrepudiation? A. Blowfish B. DES C. AES D. RSA ->","completion":" D. Nonrepudiation is only possible with an asymmetric encryption algorithm. RSA is an asymmetric algorithm.

{"prompt":"Microsoft's STRIDE threat assessment framework uses six categories for threats: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. If a penetration tester is able to modify audit logs, what STRIDE categories best describe this issue? A. Tampering and information disclosure B. Elevation of privilege and tampering C. Repudiation and denial of service D. Repudiation and tampering ->","completion":" D. Modification of audit logs will prevent repudiation because the data cannot be trusted, and thus actions cannot be provably denied. The modification of the logs is also a direct example of tampering. It might initially be tempting to answer elevation of privileges and tampering, as the attacker made changes to files that should be protected, but this is an unknown without more information. Similarly, the attacker may have accessed the files, resulting in information disclosure in addition to tampering, but again, this is not specified in the question. Finally, this did not cause a denial of service, and thus that answer can be ignored.\n"}
{"prompt":"RIP, OSPF, and BGP are all examples of protocols associated with what type of network device? A. Switches B. Bridges C. Routers D. Gateways ->","completion":" C. Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) are all routing protocols and are associated with routers.\n"}

Role-based access control B. Attribute-based access control C. Administrative access control D. System discretionary access control ->","completion":" B. Each of the attributes linked to Ben's access provides information for an attributebased information control system. Attribute-based information controls like those described in NIST SP 800-162 can take many details about the user, actions, and objects into consideration before allowing access to occur. A role-based access control would simply consider Ben's role, whereas both administrative and system discretionary access controls are not commonly used terms to describe access controls.\n"}
{"prompt":"The Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) attack tool used by Anonymous leverages a multitude of home PCs to attack its chosen targets. This is an example of what type of network attack? A. DDoS B. Ionization C. Zombie horde D. Teardrop ->","completion":" A. LOIC is an example of a distributed denial of service attack. It uses many systems to attack targets, combining their bandwidth and making it difficult to shut down the attack because of the number and variety of attackers.

{"prompt":"Amanda is considering the implementation of a database recovery mechanism recommended by a consultant. In the recommended approach, an automated process will move records of transactions from the primary site to a backup site on an hourly basis. What type of database recovery technique is the consultant describing? A. Electronic vaulting B. Transaction logging C. Remote mirroring D. Remote journaling ->","completion":" D. Remote journaling transfers transaction logs to a remote site on a more frequent basis than electronic vaulting, typically hourly. Transaction logging is not a recovery technique alone; it is a process for generating the logs used in remote journaling. In an electronic vaulting approach, automated technology moves database backups from the primary database server to a remote site on a scheduled basis, typically daily. Remote mirroring maintains a live database server at the backup site and mirrors all transactions at the primary site on the server at the backup site.\n"}

NDAs do not protect against deletion or availability issues, and noncompete agreements would be required to stop competition.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan is concerned about the FAR associated with her biometric technology. What is the best method to deal with the FAR? A. Adjust the CER. B. Change the sensitivity of the system to lower the FRR. C. Add a second factor. D. Replace the biometric system. ->","completion":" C. Adding a second factor can ensure that users who might be incorrectly accepted are not given access due to a higher than desired false acceptance rate (FAR) from accessing a system. The CER is the crossover between the false acceptance and false rejection rate (FRR) and is used as a way to measure the accuracy of biometric systems. Changing the sensitivity to lower the FRR may actually increase the FAR, and replacing a biometric system can be expensive in terms of time and cost.\n"}

{"prompt":"Kim learned that the military is planning a classified mission that involves some ASI aircraft. She is concerned that employees not cleared for the mission may learn of it by noticing the movement of many aircraft to the region. Individual employees are cleared to know about the movement of an individual aircraft, but they are not cleared to know about the overall mission. What type of attack is Kim concerned about? A. Aggregation B. SQL injection C. Inference D. Multilevel security ->","completion":" A. Aggregation is a security issue that arises when a collection of facts has a higher classification than the classification of any of those facts standing alone. An inference problem occurs when an attacker can pull together pieces of less sensitive information from multiple sources and use them to derive information of greater sensitivity. In this case, only a single source was used. SQL injection is a web application exploit. Multilevel security is a system control that allows the simultaneous processing of information at different classification levels.\n"}
{"prompt":"What technique can Kim employ to prevent employees not cleared for the mission from learning the true location of the aircraft? A. Input validation B. Polyinstantiation C. Parameterization D. Server-side validation ->","completion":" B. Polyinstantiation allows the storage of multiple different pieces of information in a database at different classification levels to prevent attackers from conducting aggregation or inference attacks. Kim could store incorrect location information in the database at lower classification levels to prevent the aggregation attack in this scenario. Input validation, server-side validation, and parameterization are all techniques used to prevent web application attacks and are not effective against inference attacks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Kim's database uniquely identifies aircraft by using their tail number. Which one of the following terms would not necessarily accurately describe the tail number? A. Database field B. Foreign key C. Primary key D. Candidate key ->","completion":" B. The tail number is a database field because it is stored in the database. It is also a primary key because the question states that the database uniquely identifies aircraft using this field. Any primary key is, by definition, also a candidate key. There is no information provided that the tail number is a foreign key used to reference a different database table.\n"}

{"prompt":"What should be true for salts used in password hashes? A. A single salt should be set so passwords can be de-hashed as needed. B. A single salt should be used so the original salt can be used to check passwords against their hash. C. Unique salts should be stored for each user. D. Unique salts should be created every time a user logs in. ->","completion":" C. A unique salt should be created for each user using a secure generation method and stored in that user's record. Since attacks against hashes rely on building tables to compare the hashes against, unique salts for each user make building tables for an entire database essentially impossible鈥攖he work to recover a single user account may be feasible, but large-scale recovery requires complete regeneration of the table each time. A single salt allows rainbow tables to be generated if the salt is stolen or can be guessed based on frequently used passwords. Creating a unique salt each time a user logs in does not allow a match against a known salted hashed password.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of assessment methods are associated with mechanisms and activities based on the recommendations of NIST SP800-53A, the Guide for Assessing Security Controls in Federal Information Systems? A. Examine and interview B. Test and assess C. Test and interview D. Examine and test ->","completion":" D. NIST SP800-53 describes three processes: -Examination, which is reviewing or analyzing assessment objects like specifications, mechanisms, or activities -Interviews, which are conducted with individuals or groups of individuals -Testing, which involves evaluating activities or mechanisms for expected behavior when used or exercised Knowing the details of a given NIST document in depth can be challenging. To address a question like this, first eliminate responses that do not make sense; here, a mechanism cannot be interviewed, and test and assess both mean the same thing. This leaves only one correct answer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following controls would be most effective in detecting zero-day attack attempts? A. Signature-based intrusion detection B. Anomaly-based intrusion detection C. Strong patch management D. Full-disk encryption ->","completion":" B. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems may identify a zero-day vulnerability because it deviates from normal patterns of activity. Signature-based detection methods would not be effective because there are no signatures for zero-day vulnerabilities. Strong patch management would not be helpful because, by definition, zero-day vulnerabilities do not have patches available. Full-disk encryption would not detect an attack because it is not a detective control.\n"}
{"prompt":"The ability to store and generate passwords, provide logging and auditing capabilities, and allow password check-in and check-out are all features of what type of system? A. AAA B. Credential management C. Two-factor authentication D. Kerberos ->","completion":" B.

These include immediate response procedures, a list of individuals who should be notified of the emergency, and secondary response procedures for first responders. They do not include long-term actions such as activating business continuity protocols, ordering equipment, or activating disaster recovery sites.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Jim enters his organization's data center, he has to use a smart card and code to enter and is allowed through one set of doors. The first set of doors closes, and he must then use his card again to get through a second set, which locks behind him. What type of control is this, and what is it called? A. A physical control; a one-way trapdoor B. A logical control; a dual-swipe authorization C. A directive control; a one-way access corridor D. A preventive access control; a mantrap ->","completion":" D. A mantrap uses two sets of doors, only one of which can open at a time. A mantrap is a type of preventive access control, although its implementation is a physical control.\n"}
{"prompt":"What security control may be used to implement a concept known as two-person control? A. Mandatory vacation B. Separation of duties C. Least privilege D. Defense in depth ->","completion":" B. When following the separation-of-duties principle, organizations divide critical tasks into discrete components and ensure that no one individual has the ability to perform both actions. This prevents a single rogue individual from performing that task in an unauthorized manner and is also known as two-person control.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of access control is intended to discover unwanted or unauthorized activity by providing information after the event has occurred? A. Preventive B. Corrective C. Detective D. Directive ->","completion":" C. Detective access controls operate after the fact and are intended to detect or discover unwanted access or activity. Preventive access controls are designed to prevent the activity from occurring, whereas corrective controls return an environment to its original status after an issue occurs. Directive access controls limit or direct the actions of subjects to ensure compliance with policies.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following presents the most complex decoy environment for an attacker to explore during an intrusion attempt? A. Honeypot B. Darknet C. Honeynet D. Pseudo flaw ->","completion":" C. A honeypot is a decoy computer system used to bait intruders into attacking. A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots that creates a more sophisticated environment for intruders to explore. A pseudoflaw is a false vulnerability in a system that may attract an attacker. A darknet is a segment of unused network address space that should have no network activity and, therefore, may be easily used to monitor for illicit activity.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben's company is considering configuring their systems to work at the level shown by point A on the diagram. What level are they setting the sensitivity to? A. The FRR crossover B. The FAR point C. The CER D. The CFR ->","completion":" C. The CER is the point where FAR and FRR cross over, and it is a standard assessment used to compare the accuracy of biometric devices.\n"}
{"prompt":"At point B, what problem is likely to occur? A. False acceptance will be very high. B. False rejection will be very high. C. False rejection will be very low. D. False acceptance will be very low. ->","completion":" A. At point B, the false acceptance rate (FAR) is quite high, whereas the false rejection rate (FRR) is relatively low. This may be acceptable in some circumstances, but in organizations where a false acceptance can cause a major problem, it is likely that they should instead choose a point to the right of point A.\n"}

Which of the following countries would trigger the onward transfer provisions of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield? A. United States B. France C. Italy D. Germany ->","completion":" A. The onward transfer principle requires that organizations only exchange personal information with other organizations bound by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy principles. France, Italy, and Germany, as EU member states, are all bound by those principles. The United States does not have a comprehensive privacy law codifying those principles, so the onward transfer requirement applies.\n"}
{"prompt":"Match each one of the numbered protocols with the most accurate lettered description. Use each answer exactly once. Protocol TCP UDP DNS ARP Description A. Performs translations between MAC addresses and IP addresses B. Performs translations between FQDNs and IP addresses C. Transports data over a network in a connection-oriented fashion D. Transports data over a network in a connectionless fashion ->","completion":" The protocols match with the descriptions as follows: TCP: C. Transports data over a network in a connection-oriented fashion. UDP: D. Transports data over a network in a connectionless fashion. DNS: B. Performs translations between FQDNs and IP addresses. ARP: A. Performs translations between MAC addresses and IP addresses. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-friendly fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) into IP addresses, making it possible to easily remember websites and hostnames. ARP is used to resolve IP addresses into MAC addresses. TCP and UDP are used to control the network traffic that travels between systems. TCP does so in a connection-oriented fashion using the three-way handshake, while UDP uses connectionless \"best effort\" delivery.\n"}
{"prompt":"NIST Special Publication 800-53A describes four types of objects that can be assessed. If Ben is reviewing a password standard, which of the four types of objects is he assessing? A. A mechanism B. A specification C. An activity D. An individual ->","completion":" B. Ben is assessing a specification. Specifications are document-based artifacts like policies or designs. Activities are actions that support an information system that involves people. Mechanisms are the hardware-, software-, or firmware-based controls or systems in an information system, and an individual is one or more people applying specifications, mechanisms, or activities.\n"}
{"prompt":"What process is typically used to ensure data security for workstations that are being removed from service but that will be resold or otherwise reused? A. Destruction B. Erasing C. Sanitization D. Clearing ->","completion":" C. When done properly, a sanitization process fully ensures that data is not remnant on the system before it is reused. Clearing and erasing can both be failure prone, and of course destruction wouldn't leave a machine or device to reuse.\n"}

White box tests also have access to the source code but perform testing from a developer's perspective. Black box tests work from a user's perspective but do not have access to source code. Blue boxes are a telephone hacking tool and not a software testing technique.\n"}
{"prompt":"Harold is looking for a software development methodology that will help with a major issue he is seeing in his organization. Currently, developers and operations staff do not work together and are often seen as taking problems and \"throwing them over the fence\" to the other team. What technology management approach is designed to alleviate this problem? A. ITIL B. Lean C. ITSM D. DevOps ->","completion":" D. The DevOps approach to technology management seeks to integrate software development, operations, and quality assurance in a cohesive effort. It specifically attempts to eliminate the issue of \"throwing problems over the fence\" by building collaborative relationships between members of the IT team.\n"}
{"prompt":"NIST Special Publication 800-92, the Guide to Computer Security Log Management, describes four types of common challenges to log management: -Many log sources -Inconsistent log content -Inconsistent timestamps -Inconsistent log formats Which of the following solutions is best suited to solving these issues? A. Implement SNMP for all logging devices. B. Implement a SIEM. C. Standardize on the Windows event log format for all devices and use NTP. D. Ensure that logging is enabled on all endpoints using their native logging formats and set their local time correctly ->","completion":" B. A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool is designed to centralize logs from many locations in many formats and to ensure that logs are read and analyzed despite differences between different systems and devices. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used for some log messaging but is not a solution that solves all of these problems. Most non-Windows devices, including network devices among others, are not designed to use the Windows event log format, although using NTP for time synchronization is a good idea. Finally, local logging is useful, but setting clocks individually will result in drift over time and won't solve the issue with many log sources.\n"}
{"prompt":"Mike has a flash memory card that he would like to reuse. The card contains sensitive information. What technique can he use to securely remove data from the card and allow its reuse? A. Degaussing B. Physical destruction C. Overwriting D. Reformatting ->","completion":" C. Mike should use overwriting to protect this device. While degaussing is a valid secure data removal technique, it would not be effective in this case, since degaussing works only on magnetic media. Physical destruction would prevent the reuse of the device. Reformatting is not a valid secure data removal technique.\n"}
{"prompt":"Carlos is investigating the compromise of sensitive information in his organization. He believes that attackers managed to retrieve personnel information on all employees from the database and finds the following user-supplied input in a log entry for a web-based personnel management system: What type of attack took place? A. SQL injection B. Buffer overflow C. Cross-site scripting D. Cross-site request forgery ->","completion":" A. The single quotation mark in the input field is a telltale sign that this is a SQL injection attack. The quotation mark is used to escape outside the SQL code's input field and the text that follows is used to directly manipulate the SQL command sent from the web application to the database.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is a detailed, step-by-step document that describes the exact actions that individuals must complete? A. Policy B. Standard C. Guideline D. Procedure ->","completion":" D. Procedures are formal, mandatory documents that provide detailed, step-by-step actions required from individuals performing a task.\n"}
{"prompt":"What principle of relational databases ensures the permanency of transactions that have successfully completed? A. Atomicity B. Consistency C. Isolation D. Durability ->","completion":" D. Durability requires that once a transaction is committed to the database it must be preserved. Atomicity ensures that if any part of a database transaction fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back as if it never occurred. Consistency ensures that all transactions are consistent with the logical rules of the database, such as having a primary key. Isolation requires that transactions operate separately from each other.\n"}
{"prompt":"Bryan has a set of sensitive documents that he would like to protect from public disclosure. He would like to use a control that, if the documents appear in a public forum, may be used to trace the leak back to the person who was originally given the document copy. What security control would best fulfill this purpose? A. Digital signature B. Document staining C. Hashing D. Watermarking ->","completion":" D. Watermarking alters a digital object to embed information about the source, in either a visible or hidden form. Digital signatures may identify the source of a document but they are easily removed. Hashing would not provide any indication of the document source, since anyone could compute a hash value. Document staining is not a security control.\n"}
{"prompt":"Carlos is planning a design for a data center that will be constructed within a new fourstory corporate headquarters. The building consists of a basement and three above-ground floors. What is the best location for the data center? A. Basement B. First floor C. Second floor D. Third floor ->","completion":" C. Data centers should be located in the core of a building. Locating it on lower floors makes it susceptible to flooding and physical break-ins. Locating it on the top floor makes it vulnerable to wind and roof damage.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chris is an information security professional for a major corporation and, as he is walking into the building, he notices that the door to a secure area has been left ajar. Physical security does not fall under his responsibility, but he takes immediate action by closing the door and informing the physical security team of his action. What principle is Chris demonstrating? A. Due care B. Due diligence C. Separation of duties D. Informed consent ->","completion":" A. The due care principle states that an individual should react in a situation using the same level of care that would be expected from any reasonable person. It is a very broad standard. The due diligence principle is a more specific component of due care that states that an individual assigned a responsibility should exercise due care to complete it accurately and in a timely manner.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following investigation types always uses the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof? A. Civil investigation B. Criminal investigation C. Operational investigation D. Regulatory investigation ->","completion":" B. Criminal investigations have high stakes with severe punishment for the offender that may include incarceration. Therefore, they use the strictest standard of evidence of all investigations: beyond a reasonable doubt. Civil investigations use a preponderance-of-theevidence standard. Regulatory investigations may use whatever standard is appropriate for the venue where the evidence will be heard. This may include the beyond-a-reasonabledoubt standard, but it is not always used in regulatory investigations. Operational investigations do not use a standard of evidence.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following backup types does not alter the status of the archive bit on a file? A. Full backup B. Incremental backup C. Partial backup D. Differential backup ->","completion":" D. Differential backups do not alter the archive bit on a file, whereas incremental and full backups reset the archive bit to 0 after the backup completes.

{"prompt":"A web application accesses information in a database to retrieve user information. What is the web application acting as? A. A subject B. An object C. A user D. A token ->","completion":" A. Subjects are active entities that can access a passive object to retrieve information from or about an object. Subjects can also make changes to objects when they are properly authorized. Users are often subjects, but not all subjects are users.\n"}
{"prompt":"The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is a routing protocol that keeps a map of all connected remote networks and uses that map to select the shortest path to a remote destination. What type of routing protocol is OSPF? A. Link state B. Shortest path first C. Link mapping D. Distance vector ->","completion":" A. OSPF is a link state protocol. Link state protocols maintain a topographical map of all connected networks and preferentially select the shortest path to remote networks for traffic. A distance vector protocol would map the direction and distance in hops to a remote network, whereas shortest path first and link mapping are not types of routing protocols.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following categories consists of first-generation programming languages? A. Machine languages B. Assembly languages C. Compiled languages D. Natural language ->","completion":" A. Machine languages are examples of first-generation programming languages. Second-generation languages include assembly languages. Third-generation languages include compiled languages. Fourth- and fifth-generation languages go beyond standard compiled languages to include natural languages and declarative approaches to programming.\n"}
{"prompt":"What backup should Tara apply to the server first? A. Sunday's full backup B. Monday's differential backup C. Tuesday's differential backup D. Wednesday's differential backup ->","completion":" A. Tara first must achieve a system baseline. She does this by applying the most recent full backup to the new system. This is Sunday's full backup. Once Tara establishes this baseline, she may then proceed to apply differential backups to bring the system back to a more recent state.\n"}
{"prompt":"How many backups in total must Tara apply to the system to make the data it contains as current as possible? A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 4 ->","completion":" B. To restore the system to as current a state as possible, Tara must first apply Sunday's full backup. She may then apply the most recent differential backup, from Wednesday at noon. Differential backups include all files that have changed since the most recent full backup, so the contents of Wednesday's backup contain all of the data that would be contained in Monday and Tuesday's backups, making the Monday and Tuesday backups irrelevant for this scenario.\n"}
{"prompt":"In this backup approach, some data may be irretrievably lost. How long is the time period where any changes made will have been lost? A. 3 hours. B. 5 hours. C. 8 hours. D. No data will be lost. ->","completion":" A. In this scenario, the differential backup was made at noon and the server failed at 3 p.m. Therefore, any data modified or created between noon and 3 p.m. will not be contained on any backup and will be irretrievably lost.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Tara followed the same schedule but switched the differential backups to incremental backups, how many backups in total would she need to apply to the system to make the data it contains as current as possible? A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 4 ->","completion":" D. By switching from differential to incremental backups, Tara's weekday backups will only contain the information changed since the previous day. Therefore, she must apply all of the available incremental backups. She would begin by restoring the Sunday full backup and then apply the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday incremental backups.\n"}
{"prompt":"If Tara made the change from differential to incremental backups and we assume that the same amount of information changes each day, which one of the following files would be the largest? A. Monday's incremental backup B. Tuesday's incremental backup C. Wednesday's incremental backup D. All three will be the same size. ->","completion":" D. Each incremental backup contains only the information changed since the most recent full or incremental backup. If we assume that the same amount of information changes every day, each of the incremental backups would be roughly the same size.\n"}
{"prompt":"Susan is conducting a STRIDE threat assessment by placing threats into one or more of the following categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. As part of her assessment, she has discovered an issue that allows transactions to be modified between a web browser and the application server that it accesses. What STRIDE categorization(s) best fit this issue? A. Tampering and Information Disclosure B. Spoofing and Tampering C. Tampering and Repudiation D. Information Disclosure and Elevation of Privilege ->","completion":" A. Information that is modifiable between a client and a server also means that it is accessible, pointing to both tampering and information disclosure. Spoofing in STRIDE is aimed at credentials and authentication, and there is no mention of this in the question. Repudiation would require that proving who performed an action was important, and elevation of privilege would come into play if privilege levels were involved.\n"}
{"prompt":"Bob has been tasked with writing a policy that describes how long data should be kept and when it should be purged. What concept does this policy deal with? A. Data remanence B. Record retention C. Data redaction D. Audit logging ->","completion":" B. Record retention ensures that data is kept and maintained as long as it is needed, and that it is purged when it is no longer necessary. Data remanence occurs when data is left behind after an attempt is made to remove it, whereas data redaction is not a technical term used to describe this effort. Finally, audit logging may be part of the records retained but doesn't describe the lifecycle of data.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which component of IPsec provides authentication, integrity, and nonrepudiation? A. L2TP B. Encapsulating Security Payload C. Encryption Security Header D. Authentication Header ->","completion":" D. The Authentication Header provides authentication, integrity, and nonrepudiation for IPsec connections. The Encapsulating Security Payload provides encryption and thus provides confidentiality. It can also provide limited authentication. L2TP is an independent VPN protocol, and Encryption Security Header is a made-up term.\n"}

What type of attack did Renee most likely experience? A. Denial of service B. Reconnaissance C. Malicious insider D. Compromise ->","completion":" B. The attack described in the scenario is a classic example of TCP scanning, a network reconnaissance technique that may precede other attacks. There is no evidence that the attack disrupted system availability, which would characterize a denial of service attack; that it was waged by a malicious insider; or that the attack resulted in the compromise of a system.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of Windows audit record describes events like an OS shutdown or a service being stopped? A. An application log B. A security log C. A system log D. A setup log ->","completion":" C. Windows system logs include reboots, shutdowns, and service state changes. Application logs record events generated by programs, security logs track events like logins and uses of rights, and setup logs track application setup.\n"}
{"prompt":"In the ring protection model shown here, what ring does not run in privileged mode? A. Ring 0 B. Ring 1 C. Ring 2 D. Ring 3 ->","completion":" D. The kernel lies within the central ring, Ring 0. Ring 1 contains other operating system components. Ring 2 is used for drivers and protocols. User-level programs and applications run at Ring 3. Rings 0 to 2 run in privileged mode, whereas Ring 3 runs in user mode.\n"}
{"prompt":"What level of RAID is also known as disk striping? A. RAID 0 B. RAID 1 C. RAID 5 D. RAID 10 ->","completion":" A. RAID level 0 is also known as disk striping. RAID 1 is called disk mirroring. RAID 5 is called disk striping with parity. RAID 10 is known as a stripe of mirrors.\n"}
{"prompt":"Jacob executes an attack against a system using a valid but low-privilege user account by accessing a file pointer that the account has access to. After the access check, but before the file is opened, he quickly switches the file pointer to point to a file that the user account does not have access to. What type of attack is this? A. TOCTOU B. Permissions creep C. Impersonation D. Link swap ->","completion":" A. This is an example of a time of check\/time of use, or TOC\/TOU attack. It exploits the difference between the times when a system checks for permission to perform an action and when the action is actually performed. Permissions creep would occur if the account had gained additional rights over time as the other's role or job changed. Impersonation occurs when an attacker pretends to be a valid user, and link swap is not a type of attack.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the minimum number of disks required to implement RAID level 0? A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 5 ->","completion":" B. RAID 0, or disk striping, requires at least two disks to implement. It improves performance of the storage system but does not provide fault tolerance.\n"}
{"prompt":"Fred's company wants to ensure the integrity of email messages sent via their central email servers. If the confidentiality of the messages is not critical, what solution should Fred suggest? A. Digitally sign and encrypt all messages to ensure integrity. B. Digitally sign but don't encrypt all messages. C. Use TLS to protect messages, ensuring their integrity. D. Use a hashing algorithm to provide a hash in each message to prove that it hasn't changed. ->","completion":" B. Fred's company needs to protect integrity, which can be accomplished by digitally signing messages. Any change will cause the signature to be invalid. Encrypting isn't necessary because the company does not want to protect confidentiality. TLS can provide in-transit protection but won't protect integrity of the messages, and of course a hash used without a way to verify that the hash wasn't changed won't ensure integrity either.\n"}
{"prompt":"The leadership at Susan's company has asked her to implement an access control system that can support rule declarations like \"Only allow access to salespeople from managed devices on the wireless network between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.\" What type of access control system would be Susan's best choice? A. ABAC B. RBAC C. DAC D. MAC ->","completion":" A. An attribute-based access control (ABAC) system will allow Susan to specify details about subjects, objects, and access, allowing granular control. Although a rule-based access control system (RBAC) might allow this, the attribute-based access control system can be more specific and thus is more flexible. Discretionary access control (DAC) would allow object owners to make decisions, and mandatory access controls (MACs) would use classifications; neither of these capabilities was described in the requirements.\n"}
{"prompt":"What type of communications rely on a timing mechanism using either an independent clock or a time stamp embedded in the communications? A. Analog B. Digital C. Synchronous D. Asynchronous ->","completion":" C. Synchronous communications use a timing or clock mechanism to control the data stream. This can permit very fast communication.\n"}

The investigator asks him to retrieve a forensic drive controller, but Howard cannot locate a device in the storage room with this name. What is another name for a forensic drive controller? A. RAID controller B. Write blocker C. SCSI terminator D. Forensic device analyzer ->","completion":" B. One of the main functions of a forensic drive controller is preventing any command sent to a device from modifying data stored on the device. For this reason, forensic drive controllers are also often referred to as write blockers.\n"}
{"prompt":"The web application that Saria's development team is working on needs to provide secure session management that can prevent hijacking of sessions using the cookies that the application relies on. Which of the following techniques would be the best for her to recommend to prevent this? A. Set the Secure attribute for the cookies, thus forcing TLS. B. Set the Domain cookie attribute to example.com to limit cookie access to servers in the same domain. C. Set the Expires cookie attribute to less than a week. D. Set the HTTPOnly attribute to require only unencrypted sessions. ->","completion":" A. Setting the Secure cookie will only allow cookies to be sent via HTTPS TLS or SSL sessions, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks that target cookies. The rest of the settings are problematic: Cookies are vulnerable to DNS spoofing. Domain cookies should usually have the narrowest possible scope, which is actually accomplished by not setting the Domain cookie. This allows only the originating server to access the cookie. Cookies without the Expires or Max-age attributes are ephemeral and will only be kept for the session, making them less vulnerable than stored cookies. Normally, the HTTPOnly attribute is a good idea, but it prevents scripting rather than requiring unencrypted HTTP sessions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben's company has recently retired their fleet of multifunction printers. Their information security team has expressed concerns that the printers contain hard drives and that they may still have data from scans and print jobs. What is the technical term for this issue? A. Data pooling B. Failed clearing C. Data permanence D. Data remanence ->","completion":" D. Data remanence describes data that is still on media after an attempt has been made to remove it. Failed clearing and data pooling are not technical terms, and data permanence describes how long data lasts.\n"}
{"prompt":"What access control scheme labels subjects and objects, and allows subjects to access objects when the labels match? A. DAC B. MAC C. Rule-based access control (RBAC) D. Role-based access control (RBAC) ->","completion":" B. Mandatory access control (MAC) applies labels to subjects and objects and allows subjects to access objects when their labels match. Discretionary access control (DAC) is controlled by the owner of objects, rule-based access control applies rules throughout a system, and role-based access control bases rights on roles, which are often handled as groups of users.\n"}
{"prompt":"A cloud-based service that provides account provisioning, management, authentication, authorization, reporting, and monitoring capabilities is known as what type of service? A. PaaS B. IDaaS C. IaaS D. SaaS ->","completion":" B. Identity as a service (IDaaS) provides capabilities such as account provisioning, management, authentication, authorization, reporting, and monitoring.

What type of issues can't a strictly post-admission policy handle? A. Out-of-band monitoring B. Preventing an unpatched laptop from being exploited immediately after connecting to the network C. Denying access when user behavior doesn't match an authorization matrix D. Allowing user access when user behavior is allowed based on an authorization matrix ->","completion":" B. A post-admission philosophy allows or denies access based on user activity after connection. Since this doesn't check the status of a machine before it connects, it can't prevent the exploit of the system immediately after connection. This doesn't preclude out-of-band or in-band monitoring, but it does mean that a strictly post-admission policy won't handle system checks before the systems are admitted to the network.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ben has built an access control list that lists the objects that his users are allowed to access. When users attempt to access an object that they don't have rights to, they are denied access, even though there isn't a specific rule that prevents it. What access control principle is key to this behavior? A. Least privilege B. Implicit deny C. Explicit deny D. Final rule fall-through ->","completion":" B. The principle of implicit denial states that any action that is not explicitly allowed is denied. This is an important concept for firewall rules and other access control systems. Implementing least privilege ensures that subjects have only the rights they need to accomplish their job. While explicit deny and final rule fall-through may sound like important access control concepts, neither is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Mary is a security risk analyst for an insurance company.

Choose 5% of records from the middle of the day. ->","completion":" A. Val can use statistical sampling techniques to choose a set of records for review that are representative of the entire day's data. Clipping chooses only records that exceed a set threshold, so it is not a representative sample. Choosing records based on the time they are recorded may not produce a representative sample because it may capture events that occur at the same time each day and miss many events that simply don't occur during the chosen time period.\n"}

A. Plaintext salting B. Salt reuse C. Use of a short salt D. Poor salt algorithm selection ->","completion":" B. Ben is reusing his salt. When the same salt is used for each hash, all users with the same password will have the same hash, and the attack can either attempt to steal the salt or may attempt to guess the salt by targeting the most frequent hash occurrences based on commonly used passwords. Short salts are an issue, but the salts used here are 32 bytes (256 bits) long. There is no salting algorithm used or mentioned here; salt is an added value for a hash, and plaintext salting is a made-up term.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is an example of risk transference? A. Building a guard shack B. Purchasing insurance C. Erecting fences D. Relocating facilities ->","completion":" B.

B. Cellular provider networks are private networks and should not require special consideration. C. Encrypt all traffic to ensure confidentiality. D. Require the use of WAP for all data sent from the phone. ->","completion":" A. Cellular networks have the same issues that any public network does. Encryption requirements should match those that the organization selects for other public networks like hotels, conference Wi-Fi, and similar scenarios. Encrypting all data is difficult and adds overhead, so it should not be the default answer unless the company specifically requires it. WAP is a dated wireless application protocol and is not in broad use; requiring it would be difficult. WAP does provide TLS, which would help when in use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Fred intends to attend a major hacker conference this year. What should he do when connecting to his cellular provider's 4G network while at the conference? A. Continue normal usage. B. Discontinue all usage; towers can be spoofed. C. Only use trusted Wi-Fi networks. D. Connect to his company's encrypted VPN service ->","completion":" D. Fred's best option is to use an encrypted, trusted VPN service to tunnel all of his data usage. Trusted Wi-Fi networks are unlikely to exist at a hacker conference, normal usage is dangerous due to the proliferation of technology that allows fake towers to be set up, and discontinuing all usage won't support Fred's business needs.\n"}

What type of test should Norm choose? A. Full interruption test B. Parallel test C. Tabletop exercise D. Checklist review ->","completion":" A. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing but the primary site remains operational. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ed is building a network that supports IPv6 but needs to connect it to an IPv4 network. What type of device should Ed place between the networks? A. A switch B. A router C. A bridge D. A gateway ->","completion":" D. Ed's best option is to install an IPv6 to IPv4 gateway that can translate traffic between the networks. A bridge would be appropriate for different types of networks, whereas a router would make sense if the networks were similar. A modern switch might be able to carry both types of traffic but wouldn't be much help translating between the two protocols.\n"}

{"prompt":"Tammy is selecting a disaster recovery facility for her organization. She would like to choose a facility that balances the time required to recover operations with the cost involved. What type of facility should she choose? A. Hot site B. Warm site C. Cold site D. Red site ->","completion":" B. Tammy should choose a warm site. This type of facility meets her requirements for a good balance between cost and recovery time. It is less expensive than a hot site but facilitates faster recovery than a cold site. A red site is not a type of disaster recovery facility.\n"}
{"prompt":"What layer of the OSI model is associated with datagrams? A. Session B. Transport C. Network D. Data Link ->","completion":" B. When data reaches the Transport layer, it is sent as segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). Above the Transport layer, data becomes a data stream, while below the Transport layer they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer, and bits at the Physical layer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following is not a valid key length for the Advanced Encryption Standard? A. 128 bits B. 192 bits C. 256 bits D. 384 bits ->","completion":" D. The Advanced Encryption Standard supports encryption with 128-bit keys, 192-bit keys, and 256-bit keys.\n"}
{"prompt":"Which one of the following technologies provides a function interface that allows developers to directly interact with systems without knowing the implementation details of that system? A. Data dictionary B. Object model C. Source code D. API ->","completion":" D. An application programming interface (API) allows developers to create a direct method for other users to interact with their systems through an abstraction that does not require knowledge of the implementation details. Access to object models, source code, and data dictionaries also indirectly facilitate interaction but do so in a manner that provides other developers with implementation details.\n"}
{"prompt":"When Ben lists the files on a Linux system, he sees a set of attributes as shown in the following image. The letters rwx indicate different levels of what? A. Identification B. Authorization C. Authentication D. Accountability ->","completion":" B. The permissions granted on files in Linux designate what authorized users can do with those files-read, write, or execute. In the image shown, all users can read, write, and execute index.html, whereas the owner can read, write, and execute example.txt, the group cannot, and everyone can write and execute it.\n"}
