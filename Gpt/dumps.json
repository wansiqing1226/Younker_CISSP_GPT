What goal is Ben trying to achieve? A. Authentication B. Authorization C. Integrity D. Nonrepudiation", "completion": "D. Nonrepudiation allows a recipient to prove to a third party that a message came from a purported source. Authentication would provide proof to Ben that the sender was authentic, but Ben would not be able to prove this to a third party."}
{"prompt": "What principle of information security states that an organization should implement overlapping security controls whenever possible? A. Least privilege B. Separation of duties C. Defense in depth D. Security through obscurity", "completion": "C. Defense in depth states that organizations should have overlapping security controls designed to meet the same security objectives whenever possible. This approach provides security in the event of a single control failure."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following is not a goal of a formal change management program? A. Implement change in an orderly fashion. B. Test changes prior to implementation. C. Provide rollback plans for changes. D. Inform stakeholders of changes after they occur.", "completion": "D. Stakeholders should be informed of changes before, not after, they occur. The other items listed are goals of change management programs."}
{"prompt": "Ben is responsible for the security of payment card information stored in a database. Policy directs that he remove the information from the database, but he cannot do this for operational reasons. He obtained an exception to policy and is seeking an appropriate compensating control to mitigate the risk. What would be his best option? A. Purchasing insurance B. Encrypting the database contents C. Removing the data D. Objecting to the exception", "completion": "B. Ben should encrypt the data to provide an additional layer of protection as a compensating control. The organization has already made a policy exception, so he should not react by objecting to the exception or removing the data without authorization. Purchasing insurance may transfer some of the risk but is not a mitigating control."}

{"prompt": "Ryan is a security risk analyst for an insurance company. He is currently examining a scenario in which a malicious hacker might use a SQL injection attack to deface a web server due to a missing patch in the company's web application. In this scenario, what is the threat? A. Unpatched web application B. Web defacement C. Malicious hacker D. Operating system", "completion": "C. Risks are the combination of a threat and a vulnerability. Threats are the external forces seeking to undermine security, such as the malicious hacker in this case.Vulnerabilities are the internal weaknesses that might allow a threat to succeed. In this case, the missing patch is the vulnerability. In this scenario, if the malicious hacker (threat) attempts a SQL injection attack against the unpatched server (vulnerability), the result is website defacement."}
{"prompt": "Based upon the information in this scenario, what is the exposure factor for the effect of a tornado on Atwood Landing's data center? A. 10% B. 25% C. 50% D. 75%", "completion": "C. The exposure factor is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. In this case, that is $5 million in damage divided by the $10 million facility value, or 50%."}
{"prompt": "Based upon the information in this scenario, what is the annualized rate of occurrence for a tornado at Atwood Landing's data center? A. 0.0025 B. 0.005 C. 0.01 D. 0.015", "completion": "B. The annualized rate of occurrence is the number of times that risk analysts expect a risk to happen in any given year. In this case, the analysts expect tornados once every 200 years, or 0.005 times per year."}
{"prompt": "Based upon the information in this scenario, what is the annualized loss expectancy for a tornado at Atwood Landing's data center? A. $25,000 B. $50,000 C. $250,000 D. $500,000", "completion": "A. The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $5,000,000, and the ARO is 0.005. Multiplying these numbers together gives you the ALE of $25,000."}
{"prompt": "John is analyzing an attack against his company in which the attacker found comments embedded in HTML code that provided the clues needed to exploit a software vulnerability. Using the STRIDE model, what type of attack did he uncover? A. Spoofing B. Repudiation C. Information disclosure D. Elevation of privilege", "completion": "C. Information disclosure attacks rely upon the revelation of private, confidential, or controlled information. Programming comments embedded in HTML code are an example of this type of attack."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following is an administrative control that can protect the confidentiality of information? A. Encryption B. Nondisclosure agreement C. Firewall D. Fault tolerance", "completion": "B. Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) protect the confidentiality of sensitive information by requiring that employees and affiliates not share confidential information with third parties. NDAs normally remain in force after an employee leaves the company."}
{"prompt": "Chris is worried that the laptops that his organization has recently acquired were modified by a third party to include keyloggers before they were delivered. Where should he focus his efforts to prevent this? A. His supply chain B. His vendor contracts C. His post-purchase build process D. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM)", "completion": "A. Supply chain management can help ensure the security of hardware, software, and services that an organization acquires. Chris should focus on each step that his laptops take from the original equipment manufacturer to delivery."}
{"prompt": "STRIDE, PASTA, and VAST are all examples of what type of tool? A. Risk assessment methodologies B. Control matrices C. Threat modeling methodologies D. Awareness campaign tools", "completion": "C. STRIDE, Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA), and Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) modeling are all threat modeling methodologies. STRIDE was designed for applications and operating systems (but can be used more broadly), PASTA is a risk-centric modeling system, and VAST is a threat modeling concept based on Agile project management and programming techniques."}
{"prompt": "In her role as a developer for an online bank, Lisa is required to submit her code for testing and review. After it passes through this process and it is approved, another employee moves the code to the production environment. What security management does this process describe? A. Regression testing B. Code review C. Change management D. Fuzz testing", "completion": "C. Change management is a critical control process that involves systematically managing change. Without it, Lisa might simply deploy her code to production without oversight, documentation, or testing. Regression testing focuses on testing to ensure that new code doesn鈥檛 bring back old flaws, while fuzz testing feeds unexpected input to code. Code review reviews the source code itself and may be involved in the change management process but isn鈥檛 what is described here."}
{"prompt": "After completing the first year of his security awareness program, Charles reviews the data about how many staff completed training compared to how many were assigned the training to determine whether he hit the 95 percent completion rate he was aiming for. What is this type of measure called? A. A KPI B. A metric C. An awareness control D. A return on investment rate", "completion": "A. Charles is tracking a key performance indicator (KPI). A KPI is used to measure performance (and success). Without a definition of success, this would simply be a metric, but Charles is working toward a known goal and can measure against it. There is not a return investment calculation in this problem, and the measure is not a control."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following is not typically included in a prehire screening process? A. A drug test B. A background check C. Social media review D. Fitness evaluation", "completion": "D. A fitness evaluation is not a typical part of a hiring process. Drug tests, background checks, and social media checks are all common parts of current hiring practices."}
{"prompt": "The (ISC)2 code of ethics applies to all CISSP holders. Which of the following is not one of the four mandatory canons of the code? A. Protect society, the common good, the necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure B. Disclose breaches of privacy, trust, and ethics C. Provide diligent and competent service to the principles D. Advance and protect the profession", "completion": "B. The (ISC)2 code of ethics also includes \"Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally\" but does not specifically require credential holders to disclose all breaches of privacy, trust, or ethics."}
{"prompt": "Greg's company recently experienced a significant data breach involving the personal data of many of their customers. Which breach laws should they review to ensure that they are taking appropriate action? A. The breach laws in the state where they are headquartered B. The breach laws of states they do business in C. Only federal breach laws D. Breach laws only cover government agencies, not private businesses", "completion": "B. In general, companies should be aware of the breach laws in any location where they do business. US states have a diverse collection of breach laws and requirements, meaning that in this case, Greg鈥檚 company may need to review many different breach laws to determine which they may need to comply with if they conduct business in the state or with the state鈥檚 residents."}
{"prompt": "Lawrence has been asked to perform vulnerability scans and a risk assessment of systems. Which organizational process are these more likely to be associated with? A. A merger B. A divestiture C. A layoff D. A financial audit", "completion": "A. When organizations merge, it is important to understand the state of the security for both organizations. Running vulnerability scans and performing a risk assessment are both common steps taken when preparing to merge two (or more!) IT environments."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following is not typically part of a termination process? A. An exit interview B. Recovery of property C. Account termination D. Signing an NCA", "completion": "D. Signing a noncompete or nondisclosure agreement is typically done at hiring. Exit interviews, recovery of organizational property, and account termination are all common elements of a termination process."}
{"prompt": "Laura has been asked to perform an SCA. What type of organization is she most likely in? A. Higher education B. Banking C. Government D. Healthcare", "completion": "C. A security controls assessment (SCA) most often refers to a formal US government process for assessing security controls and is often paired with a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) process. This means that Laura is probably part of a government organization or contractor."}
{"prompt": "After conducting a qualitative risk assessment of her organization, Sally recommends purchasing cybersecurity breach insurance. What type of risk response behavior is she recommending? A. Accept B. Transfer C. Reduce D. Reject", "completion": "B. Purchasing insurance is a means of transferring risk. If Sally had worked to decrease the likelihood of the events occurring, she would have been using a reduce or risk mitigation strategy, while simply continuing to function as the organization has would be an example of an acceptance strategy. Rejection, or denial of the risk, is not a valid strategy, even though it occurs!"}
{"prompt": "Angela is an information security architect at a bank and has been assigned to ensure that transactions are secure as they traverse the network. She recommends that all transactions use TLS. What threat is she most likely attempting to stop, and what method is she using to protect against it? A. Man-in-the-middle, VPN B. Packet injection, encryption C. Sniffing, encryption D. Sniffing, TEMPEST", "completion": "C. Encryption is often used to protect traffic like bank transactions from sniffing. While packet injection and man-in-the-middle attacks are possible, they are far less likely to occur, and if a VPN were used, it would be used to provide encryption. TEMPEST is a specification for techniques used to prevent spying using electromagnetic emissions and wouldn鈥檛 be used to stop attacks at any normal bank."}
{"prompt": "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) is a framework for information technology (IT) management and governance. Which data management role is most likely to select and apply COBIT to balance the need for security controls against business requirements? A. Business owners B. Data processors C. Data owners D. Data stewards", "completion": "A. Business owners have to balance the need to provide value with regulatory, security, and other requirements. This makes the adoption of a common framework like COBIT attractive. Data owners are more likely to ask that those responsible for control selection identify a standard to use. Data processors are required to perform specific actions under regulations like the EU GDPR. Finally, in many organizations, data stewards are internal roles that oversee how data is used."}
{"prompt": "What term is used to describe a starting point for a minimum security standard? A. Outline B. Baseline C. Policy D. Configuration guide", "completion": "B. A baseline is used to ensure a minimum security standard. A policy is the foundation that a standard may point to for authority, and a configuration guide may be built from a baseline to help staff who need to implement it to accomplish their task. An outline is helpful, but outline isn鈥檛 the term you鈥檙e looking for here."}
{"prompt": "When media is labeled based on the classification of the data it contains, what rule is typically applied regarding labels? A. The data is labeled based on its integrity requirements. B. The media is labeled based on the highest classification level of the data it contains. C. The media is labeled with all levels of classification of the data it contains. D. The media is labeled with the lowest level of classification of the data it contains.", "completion": "B. Media is typically labeled with the highest classification level of data it contains. This prevents the data from being handled or accessed at a lower classification level. Data integrity requirements may be part of a classification process but don鈥檛 independently drive labeling in a classification scheme."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following administrative processes assists organizations in assigning appropriate levels of security control to sensitive information? A. Information classification B. Remanence C. Transmitting data D. Clearing", "completion": "A. The need to protect sensitive data drives information classification. This allows organizations to focus on data that needs to be protected rather than spending effort on less important data. Remanence describes data left on media after an attempt is made to remove the data. Transmitting data isn鈥檛 a driver for an administrative process to protect sensitive data, and clearing is a technical process for removing data from media."}
{"prompt": "How can a data retention policy help to reduce liabilities? A. By ensuring that unneeded data isn't retained B. By ensuring that incriminating data is destroyed C. By ensuring that data is securely wiped so it cannot be restored for legal discovery D. By reducing the cost of data storage required by law", "completion": "A. A data retention policy can help to ensure that outdated data is purged, removing potential additional costs for discovery. Many organizations have aggressive retention policies to both reduce the cost of storage and limit the amount of data that is kept on hand and discoverable. Data retention policies are not designed to destroy incriminating data, and legal requirements for data retention must still be met."}
{"prompt": "Staff in an information technology (IT) department who are delegated responsibility for day-to-day tasks hold what data role? A. Business owner B. User C. Data processor D. Custodian", "completion": "D. Custodians are delegated the role of handling day-to-day tasks by managing and overseeing how data is handled, stored, and protected. Data processors are systems used to process data. Business owners are typically project or system owners who are tasked with making sure systems provide value to their users or customers."}
{"prompt": "Susan works for an American company that conducts business with customers in the European Union. What is she likely to have to do if she is responsible for handling PII from those customers? A. Encrypt the data at all times. B. Label and classify the data according to HIPAA. C. Conduct yearly assessments to the PCI DSS standard. D. Comply with a standard such as the US-EU Privacy Shield.", "completion": "D. Privacy Shield compliance helps US companies meet the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Yearly assessments may be useful, but they aren鈥檛 required. HIPAA is a US law that applies specifically to healthcare and related organizations, and encrypting all data all the time is impossible (at least if you want to use the data!). PCI DSS is a global contractual regulation for the handling of credit card information."}
{"prompt": "Ben has been tasked with identifying security controls for systems covered by his organization's information classification system. Why might Ben choose to use a security baseline? A. It applies in all circumstances, allowing consistent security controls. B. They are approved by industry standards bodies, preventing liability. C. They provide a good starting point that can be tailored to organizational needs. D. They ensure that systems are always in a secure state.", "completion": "C. Security baselines provide a starting point to scope and tailor security controls to your organization鈥檚 needs. They aren鈥檛 always appropriate to specific organizational needs, they cannot ensure that systems are always in a secure state, and they do not prevent liability."}
{"prompt": "What term is used to describe overwriting media to allow for its reuse in an environment operating at the same sensitivity level? A. Clearing B. Erasing C. Purging D. Sanitization", "completion": "A. Clearing describes preparing media for reuse. When media is cleared, unclassified data is written over all addressable locations on the media. Once that鈥檚 completed, the media can be reused. Erasing is the deletion of files or media. Purging is a more intensive form of clearing for reuse in lower-security areas, and sanitization is a series of processes that removes data from a system or media while ensuring that the data is unrecoverable by any means."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following classification levels is the United States (U.S.) government's classification label for data that could cause damage but wouldn't cause serious or grave damage? A. Top Secret B. Secret C. Confidential D. Classified", "completion": "C. The US government uses the label Confidential for data that could cause damage if it was disclosed without authorization. Exposure of Top Secret data is considered to potentially cause grave damage, while Secret data could cause serious damage. Classified is not a level in the US government classification scheme."}
{"prompt": "What issue is common to spare sectors and bad sectors on hard drives as well as overprovisioned space on modern SSDs? A. They can be used to hide data. B. They can only be degaussed. C. They are not addressable, resulting in data remanence. D. They may not be cleared, resulting in data remanence.", "completion": "D. Spare sectors, bad sectors, and space provided for wear leveling on SSDs (overprovisioned space) may all contain data that was written to the space that will not be cleared when the drive is wiped. Most wiping utilities only deal with currently addressable space on the drive. SSDs cannot be degaussed, and wear leveling space cannot be reliably used to hide data. These spaces are still addressable by the drive, although they may not be seen by the operating system."}
{"prompt": "What term describes data that remains after attempts have been made to remove the data? A. Residual bytes B. Data remanence C. Slack space D. Zero fill", "completion": "B. Data remanence is a term used to describe data left after attempts to erase or remove data. Slack space describes unused space in a disk cluster, zero fill is a wiping methodology that replaces all data bits with zeroes, and residual bytes is a made-up term."}
{"prompt": "What civilian data classifications best fit this data? A. Unclassified, confidential, top secret B. Public, sensitive, private C. Public, sensitive, proprietary D. Public, confidential, private", "completion": "C. Information shared with customers is public, internal business could be sensitive or private, and trade secrets are proprietary. Thus, public, sensitive, proprietary matches this most closely. Confidential is a military classification, which removes two of the remaining options, and trade secrets are more damaging to lose than a private classification would allow."}
{"prompt": "What technique could you use to mark your trade secret information in case it was released or stolen and you need to identify it? A. Classification B. Symmetric encryption C. Watermarks D. Metadata", "completion": "C. A watermark is used to digitally label data and can be used to indicate ownership. Encryption would have prevented the data from being accessed if it was lost, while classification is part of the set of security practices that can help make sure the right controls are in place. Finally, metadata is used to label data and might help a data loss prevention system flag it before it leaves your organization."}
{"prompt": "What type of encryption should you use on the file servers for the proprietary data, and how might you secure the data when it is in motion? A. TLS at rest and AES in motion B. AES at rest and TLS in motion C. VPN at rest and TLS in motion D. DES at rest and AES in motion", "completion": "B. AES is a strong modern symmetric encryption algorithm that is appropriate for encrypting data at rest. TLS is frequently used to secure data when it is in transit. A virtual private network is not necessarily an encrypted connection and would be used for data in motion, while DES is an outdated algorithm and should not be used for data that needs strong security."}
{"prompt": "What does labeling data allow a DLP system to do? A. The DLP system can detect labels and apply appropriate protections. B. The DLP system can adjust labels based on changes in the classification scheme. C. The DLP system can notify the firewall that traffic should be allowed through. D. The DLP system can delete unlabeled data.", "completion": "A. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems can use labels on data to determine the appropriate controls to apply to the data. DLP systems won鈥檛 modify labels in real time and typically don鈥檛 work directly with firewalls to stop traffic. Deleting unlabeled data would cause big problems for organizations that haven鈥檛 labeled every piece of data!"}
{"prompt": "Why is it cost effective to purchase high-quality media to contain sensitive data? A. Expensive media is less likely to fail. B. The value of the data often far exceeds the cost of the media. C. Expensive media is easier to encrypt. D. More expensive media typically improves data integrity.", "completion": "B. The value of the data contained on media often exceeds the cost of the media, making more expensive media that may have a longer life span or additional capabilities like encryption support a good choice. While expensive media may be less likely to fail, the reason it makes sense is the value of the data, not just that it is less likely to fail. In general, the cost of the media doesn鈥檛 have anything to do with the ease of encryption, and data integrity isn鈥檛 ensured by better media."}
{"prompt": "Chris is responsible for workstations throughout his company and knows that some of the company's workstations are used to handle proprietary information. Which option best describes what should happen at the end of their lifecycle for workstations he is responsible for? A. Erasing B. Clearing C. Sanitization D. Destruction", "completion": "C. Sanitization is a combination of processes that ensure that data from a system cannot be recovered by any means. Erasing and clearing are both prone to mistakes and technical problems that can result in remnant data and don鈥檛 make sense for systems that handled proprietary information. Destruction is the most complete method of ensuring that data cannot be exposed, and some organizations opt to destroy the entire workstation, but that is not a typical solution due to the cost involved."}
{"prompt": "Rearrange the following U.S. government data classification levels in order, from least sensitive to most sensitive. A. Secret B. Confidential C. Unclassified D. Top Secret", "completion": "The US government鈥檚 classification levels from least to most sensitive are:C. Unclassified锛孊. Confidential锛孉. Secret锛孌. Top Secret"}
{"prompt": "What scenario describes data at rest? A. Data in an IPSec tunnel B. Data in an e-commerce transaction C. Data stored on a hard drive D. Data stored in RAM", "completion": "C. Data at rest is inactive data that is physically stored. Data in an IPsec tunnel or part of an e-commerce transaction is data in motion. Data in RAM is ephemeral and is not inactive."}
{"prompt": "If you are selecting a security standard for a Windows 10 system that processes credit cards, what security standard is your best choice? A. Microsoft's Windows 10 security baseline B. The CIS Windows 10 baseline C. PCI DSS D. The NSA Windows 10 baseline", "completion": "C. PCI DSS, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, provides the set of requirements for credit card processing systems. The Microsoft, NSA, and CIS baseline are all useful for building a Windows 10 security standard, but the PCI DSS standard is a better answer."}
{"prompt": "The CIS benchmarks are an example of what practice? A. Conducting a risk assessment B. Implementing data labeling C. Proper system ownership D. Using security baselines", "completion": "D. The CIS benchmarks are an example of a security baseline. A risk assessment would help identify which controls were needed, and proper system ownership is an important part of making sure baselines are implemented and maintained. Data labeling can help ensure that controls are applied to the right systems and data."}
{"prompt": "Adjusting the CIS benchmarks to your organization's mission and your specific IT systems would involve what two processes? A. Scoping and selection B. Scoping and tailoring C. Baselining and tailoring D. Tailoring and selection", "completion": "B. Scoping involves selecting only the controls that are appropriate for your IT systems, while tailoring matches your organization鈥檚 mission and the controls from a selected baseline. Baselining is the process of configuring a system or software to match a baseline or building a baseline itself. Selection isn鈥檛 a technical term used for any of these processes."}
{"prompt": "How should you determine what controls from the baseline a given system or software package should receive? A. Consult the custodians of the data. B. Select based on the data classification of the data it stores or handles. C. Apply the same controls to all systems. D. Consult the business owner of the process the system or data supports.", "completion": "B. The controls implemented from a security baseline should match the data classification of the data used or stored on the system. Custodians are trusted to ensure the day-to-day security of the data and should do so by ensuring that the baseline is met and maintained. Business owners often have a conflict of interest between functionality and data security, and of course, applying the same controls everywhere is expensive and may not meet business needs or be a responsible use of resources."}
{"prompt": "What problem with FTP and Telnet makes using SFTP and SSH better alternatives? A. FTP and Telnet aren't installed on many systems. B. FTP and Telnet do not encrypt data. C. FTP and Telnet have known bugs and are no longer maintained. D. FTP and Telnet are difficult to use, making SFTP and SSH the preferred solution.", "completion": "B. FTP and Telnet do not provide encryption for the data they transmit and should not be used if they can be avoided. SFTP and SSH provide encryption to protect both the data they send and the credentials that are used to log in via both utilities."}
{"prompt": "The government defense contractor that Saria works for has recently shut down a major research project and is planning on reusing the hundreds of thousands of dollars of systems and data storage tapes used for the project for other purposes. When Saria reviews the company's internal processes, she finds that she can't reuse the tapes and that the manual says they should be destroyed. Why isn't Saria allowed to degauss and then reuse the tapes to save her employer money? A. Data permanence may be an issue. B. Data remanence is a concern. C. The tapes may suffer from bitrot. D. Data from tapes can't be erased by degaussing.", "completion": "B. Many organizations require the destruction of media that contains data at higher levels of classification. Often the cost of the media is lower than the potential costs of data exposure, and it is difficult to guarantee that reused media doesn鈥檛 contain remnant data. Tapes can be erased by degaussing, but degaussing is not always fully effective. Bitrot describes the slow loss of data on aging media, while data permanence is a term sometimes used to describe the life span of data and media."}
{"prompt": "Information maintained about an individual that can be used to distinguish or trace their identity is known as what type of information? A. Personally identifiable information (PII) B. Personal health information (PHI) C. Social Security number (SSN) D. Secure identity information (SII)", "completion": "A. NIST Special Publication 800-122 defines PII as any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual鈥檚 identity, such as name, Social Security number, date and place of birth, mother鈥檚 maiden name, biometric records, and other information that is linked or linkable to an individual such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. PHI is health-related information about a specific person, Social Security numbers are issued to individuals in the United States, and SII is a made-up term."}
{"prompt": "What is the primary information security risk to data at rest? A. Improper classification B. Data breach C. Decryption D. Loss of data integrity", "completion": "B. The biggest threat to data at rest is typically a data breach. Data at rest with a high level of sensitivity is often encrypted to help prevent this. Decryption is not as significant of a threat if strong encryption is used and encryption keys are well secured. Data integrity issues could occur, but proper backups can help prevent this, and of course data could be improperly classified, but this is not the primary threat to the data."}
{"prompt": "Full disk encryption like Microsoft's BitLocker is used to protect data in what state? A. Data in transit B. Data at rest C. Unlabeled data D. Labeled data", "completion": "B. Full disk encryption only protects data at rest. Since it encrypts the full disk, it does not distinguish between labeled and unlabeled data."}
{"prompt": "Sue's employer has asked her to use an IPsec VPN to connect to its network. When Sue connects, what does the IPsec VPN allow her to do? A. Send decrypted data over a public network and act like she is on her employer's internal network. B. Create a private encrypted network carried via a public network and act like she is on her employer's internal network. C. Create a virtual private network using TLS while on her employer's internal network. D. Create a tunneled network that connects her employer's network to her internal home network", "completion": "B. One way to use an IPsec VPN is to create a private, encrypted network (or tunnel) via a public network, allowing users to be a virtual part of their employer鈥檚 internal network. IPsec is distinct from TLS and provides encryption for confidentiality and integrity, and of course, in this scenario Sue is connecting to her employer鈥檚 network rather than the employer connecting to hers."}
{"prompt": "What is the primary purpose of data classification? A. It quantifies the cost of a data breach. B. It prioritizes IT expenditures. C. It allows compliance with breach notification laws. D. It identifies the value of the data to the organization.", "completion": "D. Classification identifies the value of data to an organization. This can often help drive IT expenditure prioritization and could help with rough cost estimates if a breach occurred, but that鈥檚 not the primary purpose. Finally, most breach laws call out specific data types for notification rather than requiring organizations to classify data themselves."}
{"prompt": "Fred's organization allows downgrading of systems for reuse after projects have been finished and the systems have been purged. What concern should Fred raise about the reuse of the systems from his Top Secret classified project for a future project classified as Secret? A. The Top Secret data may be commingled with the Secret data, resulting in a need to relabel the system. B. The cost of the sanitization process may exceed the cost of new equipment. C. The data may be exposed as part of the sanitization process. D. The organization's DLP system may flag the new system due to the difference in data labels.", "completion": "B. Downgrading systems and media is rare due to the difficulty of ensuring that sanitization is complete. The need to completely wipe (or destroy) the media that systems use means that the cost of reuse is often significant and may exceed the cost of purchasing a new system or media. The goal of purging is to ensure that no data remains, so commingling data should not be a concern, nor should the exposure of the data; only staff with the proper clearance should handle the systems! Finally, a DLP system should flag data based on labels, not on the system it comes from."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following concerns should not be part of the decision when classifying data? A. The cost to classify the data B. The sensitivity of the data C. The amount of harm that exposure of the data could cause D. The value of the data to the organization", "completion": "A. Classification should be conducted based on the value of the data to the organization, its sensitivity, and the amount of harm that could result from exposure of the data. Cost should be considered when implementing controls and is weighed against the damage that exposure would create."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following is the least effective method of removing data from media? A. Degaussing B. Purging C. Erasing D. Clearing", "completion": "C. Erasing, which describes a typical deletion process in many operating systems, typically removes only the link to the file and leaves the data that makes up the file itself. The data will remain in place but not indexed until the space is needed and it is overwritten. Degaussing works only on magnetic media, but it can be quite effective on it. Purging and clearing both describe more elaborate removal processes."}
{"prompt": "What encryption technology would be appropriate for HIPAA documents in transit? A. BitLocker B. DES C. TLS D. SSL", "completion": "C. TLS is a modern encryption method used to encrypt and protect data in transit. BitLocker is a full disk encryption technology used for data at rest. DES and SSL are both outdated encryption methods and should not be used for data that requires high levels of security."}
{"prompt": "Lauren's employer asks Lauren to classify patient X-ray data that has an internal patient identifier associated with it but does not have any way to directly identify a patient. The company's data owner believes that exposure of the data could cause damage (but not exceptional damage) to the organization. How should Lauren classify the data? A. Public B. Sensitive C. Private D. Confidential", "completion": "C. We know that the data classification will not be the top level classification of \"Confidential\" because the loss of the data would not cause severe damage. This means we have to choose between private (PHI) and sensitive (confidential). Calling this private due to the patient,s personal health information fits the classification scheme, giving us the correct answer."}
{"prompt": "What technology could Lauren's employer implement to help prevent confidential data from being emailed out of the organization? A. DLP B. IDS C. A firewall D. UDP", "completion": "A. A data loss prevention (DLP) system or software is designed to identify labeled data or data that fits specific patterns and descriptions to help prevent it from leaving the organization. An IDS is designed to identify intrusions. Although some IDS systems can detect specific types of sensitive data using pattern matching, they have no ability to stop traffic. A firewall uses rules to control traffic routing, while UDP is a network protocol."}
{"prompt": "A U.S. government database contains Secret, Confidential, and Top Secret data. How should it be classified? A. Top Secret B. Confidential C. Secret D. Mixed classification", "completion": "A. When data is stored in a mixed classification environment, it is typically classified based on the highest classification of data included. In this case, the US government,s highest classification is Top Secret. Mixed classification is not a valid classification in this scheme."}
{"prompt": "What tool is used to prevent employees who leave from sharing proprietary information with their new employers? A. Encryption B. NDA C. Classification D. Purging", "completion": "B. A nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, is a legal agreement that prevents employees from sharing proprietary data with their new employers. Purging is used on media, while classification is used on data. Encryption can help secure data, but it doesn,t stop employees who can decrypt or copy the data from sharing it."}
{"prompt": "What encryption algorithm is used by both BitLocker and Microsoft's Encrypting File System? A. Blowfish B. Serpent C. AES D. 3DES", "completion": "C. By default, BitLocker and Microsoft,s Encrypting File System (EFS) both use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is the NIST-approved replacement for DES (Data Encryption Standard). Serpent was a competitor of AES, and 3DES was created as a possible replacement for DES."}
{"prompt": "Chris is responsible for his organization's security standards and has guided the selection and implementation of a security baseline for Windows PCs in his organization. How can Chris most effectively make sure that the workstations he is responsible for are being checked for compliance and that settings are being applied as necessary? A. Assign users to spot-check baseline compliance. B. Use Microsoft Group Policy. C. Create startup scripts to apply policy at system start. D. Periodically review the baselines with the data owner and system owners.", "completion": "B. Group Policy provides the ability to monitor and apply settings in a security baseline. Manual checks by users and using startup scripts provide fewer reviews and may be prone to failure, while periodic review of the baseline won,t result in compliance being checked."}
{"prompt": "What term is used to describe a set of common security configurations, often provided by a third party? A. Security policy B. Baseline C. DSS D. NIST SP 800-53", "completion": "B. A baseline is a set of security configurations that can be adopted and modified to fit an organization,s security needs. A security policy is written to describe an organization,s approach to security, while DSS is the second half of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. The NIST SP-800 series of documents address computer security in a variety of areas."}
{"prompt": "What type of policy describes how long data is retained and maintained before destruction? A. Classification B. Audit C. Record retention D. Availability", "completion": "C. Record retention policies describe how long an organization should retain data and may also specify how and when destruction should occur. Classification policies describe how and why classification should occur and who is responsible, while availability and audit policies may be created for specific purposes."}
{"prompt": "Which attack helped drive vendors to move away from SSL toward TLS-only by default? A. POODLE B. Stuxnet C. BEAST D. CRIME", "completion": "A. The POODLE (or Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack helped force the move from SSL 3.0 to TLS because it allowed attackers to easily access SSL encrypted messages. Stuxnet was a worm aimed at the Iranian nuclear program, while CRIME and BEAST were earlier attacks against SSL."}
{"prompt": "What security measure can provide an additional security control in the event that backup tapes are stolen or lost? A. Keep multiple copies of the tapes. B. Replace tape media with hard drives. C. Use appropriate security labels. D. Use AES-256 encryption.", "completion": "D. Using strong encryption, like AES-256, can help ensure that loss of removable media like tapes doesn,t result in a data breach. Security labels may help with handling processes, but they won,t help once the media is stolen or lost. Having multiple copies will ensure that you can still access the data but won,t increase the security of the media. Finally, using hard drives instead of tape only changes the media type and not the risk from theft or loss."}
{"prompt": "Joe works at a major pharmaceutical research and development company and has been tasked with writing his organization's data retention policy. As part of its legal requirements, the organization must comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Code of Federal Regulations Title 21. To do so, it is required to retain records with electronic signatures. Why would a signature be part of a retention requirement? A. It ensures that someone has reviewed the data. B. It provides confidentiality. C. It ensures that the data has not been changed. D. It validates who approved the data.", "completion": "D. Electronic signatures, as used in this rule, prove that the signature was provided by the intended signer. Electronic signatures as part of the FDA code are intended to ensure that electronic records are \"trustworthy, reliable, and generally equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures executed on paper.\" Signatures cannot provide confidentiality or integrity and don,t ensure that someone has reviewed the data."}
{"prompt": "What protocol is preferred over Telnet for remote server administration via the command line? A. SCP B. SFTP C. WDS D. SSH", "completion": "D. Secure Shell (SSH) is an encrypted protocol for remote login and command-line access. SCP and SFTP are both secure file transfer protocols, while WDS is the acronym for Windows Deployment Services, which provides remote installation capabilities for Windows operating systems."}
{"prompt": "What method uses a strong magnetic field to erase media? A. Magwipe B. Degaussing C. Sanitization D. Purging", "completion": "B. Degaussing uses strong magnetic fields to erase magnetic media. Magwipe is a made-up term. Sanitization is a combination of processes used to remove data from a system or media to ensure that it cannot be recovered. Purging is a form of clearing used on media that will be reused in a lower classification or lower-security environment."}
{"prompt": "Steve is concerned about the fact that employees leaving his organization were often privy to proprietary information. Which one of the following controls is most effective against this threat? A. Sanitization B. NDAs C. Clearing D. Encryption", "completion": "B. Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) are used to enforce confidentiality agreements with employees and may remain in effect even after an employee leaves the organization. Other controls, such as sanitization, clearing, and encryption, would not be effective against information in an employee,s memory."}
{"prompt": "Alex works for a government agency that is required to meet U.S. federal government requirements for data security. To meet these requirements, Alex has been tasked with making sure data is identifiable by its classification level. What should Alex do to the data? A. Classify the data. B. Encrypt the data. C. Label the data. D. Apply DRM to the data.", "completion": "C. Data labels are crucial to identify the classification level of information contained on the media. Digital rights management (DRM) tools provide ways to control how data is used, while encrypting it can help maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Classifying the data is necessary to label it, but it doesn,t automatically place a label on the data."}
{"prompt": "Ben is following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-88 guidelines for sanitization and disposition as shown here. He is handling information that his organization classified as sensitive, which is a moderate security categorization in the NIST model. If the media is going to be sold as surplus, what process does Ben need to follow? A. Destroy, validate, document B. Clear, purge, document C. Purge, document, validate D. Purge, validate, document", "completion": "D. The NIST SP 800-88 process for sanitization and disposition shows that media that will be reused and was classified at a moderate level should be purged and then that purge should be validated. Finally, it should be documented."}
{"prompt": "What methods are often used to protect data in transit? A. Telnet, ISDN, UDP B. BitLocker, FileVault C. AES, Serpent, IDEA D. TLS, VPN, IPSec", "completion": "D. Data in transit is data that is traversing a network or is otherwise in motion. TLS, VPNs, and IPsec tunnels are all techniques used to protect data in transit. AES, Serpent, and IDEA are all symmetric algorithms, while Telnet, ISDN, and UDP are all protocols. BitLocker and FileVault are both used to encrypt data, but they protect only stored data, not data in transit."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following data roles bears ultimate organizational responsibility for data? A. System owners B. Business owners C. Data owners D. Mission owners", "completion": "C. The data owner has ultimate responsibility for data belonging to an organization and is typically the CEO, president, or another senior employee. Business and mission owners typically own processes or programs. System owners own a system that processes sensitive data."}
{"prompt": "What U.S. government agency oversees compliance with the Privacy Shield framework for organizations wishing to use the personal data of EU citizens? A. The FAA B. The FDA C. The DoD D. The Department of Commerce", "completion": "D. The US Department of Commerce oversees Privacy Shield. Only US organizations subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or US air carriers and ticket agents subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DOT) are permitted to participate in Safe Harbor."}
{"prompt": "If Chris is one of the data owners for the organization, what steps in this process is he most likely responsible for? A. He is responsible for steps 3, 4, and 5. B. He is responsible for steps 1, 2, and 3. C. He is responsible for steps 5, 6, and 7. D. All of the steps are his direct responsibility.", "completion": "A. Chris is most likely to be responsible for classifying the data that he owns as well as assisting with or advising the system owners on security requirements and control selection. In an organization with multiple data owners, Chris is unlikely to set criteria for classifying data on his own. As a data owner, Chris will also not typically have direct responsibility for scoping, tailoring, applying, or enforcing those controls."}
{"prompt": "Chris manages a team of system administrators. What data role are they fulfilling if they conduct steps 6, 7, and 8 of the classification process? A. They are system owners and administrators. B. They are administrators and custodians. C. They are data owners and administrators. D. They are custodians and users.", "completion": "B. The system administrators are acting in the roles of data administrators who grant access and will also act as custodians who are tasked with the day-to-day application of security controls. They are not acting as data owners who own the data itself. Typically, system administrators are delegated authority by system owners, such as a department head, and of course they are tasked with providing access to users."}
{"prompt": "If Chris's company operates in the European Union and has been contracted to handle the data for a third party, what role is his company operating in when it uses this process to classify and handle data? A. Business owners B. Mission owners C. Data processors D. Data administrators", "completion": "C. Third-party organizations that process personal data on behalf of a data controller are known as data processors. The organization that they are contracting with would act in the role of the business or mission owners, and others within Chris,s organization would have the role of data administrators, granting access as needed to the data based on their operational procedures and data classification."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following is not one of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles? A. Information must be processed fairly. B. Information must be deleted within one year of acquisition. C. Information must be maintained securely. D. Information must be accurate.", "completion": "B. The GDPR does include requirements that data be processed fairly, maintained securely, and maintained accurately. It does not include a requirement that information be deleted within one year, although it does specify that information should not be kept longer than necessary."}
{"prompt": "Ben's company, which is based in the European Union, hires a third-party organization that processes data for it. Who has responsibility to protect the privacy of the data and ensure that it isn't used for anything other than its intended purpose? A. Ben's company is responsible. B. The third-party data processor is responsible. C. The data controller is responsible. D. Both organizations bear equal responsibility.", "completion": "D. Under EU regulations, both the organization sharing data and the third-party data processor bear responsibility for maintaining the privacy and security of personal information."}
{"prompt": "Major Hunter, a member of the armed forces, has been entrusted with information that, if exposed, could cause serious damage to national security. Under U.S. government classification standards, how should this data be classified? A. Unclassified B. Top Secret C. Confidential D. Secret", "completion": "D. The U.S. government specifies Secret as the classification level for information that, if disclosed, could cause serious harm to national security. Top Secret is reserved for information that could cause exceptionally grave harm, while confidential data could be expected to cause less harm. Unclassified is not an actual classification but only indicates that the data may be released to unclassified individuals. Organizations may still restrict access to unclassified information."}
{"prompt": "When a computer is removed from service and disposed of, the process that ensures that all storage media has been removed or destroyed is known as what? A. Sanitization B. Purging C. Destruction D. Declassification", "completion": "A. Sanitization is the combination of processes used to remove data from a system or media. When a PC is disposed of, sanitization includes the removal or destruction of drives, media, and any other storage devices it may have. Purging, destruction, and declassification are all other handling methods."}
{"prompt": "Linux systems that use bcrypt are using a tool based on what DES alternative encryption scheme? A. 3DES B. AES C. Diffie鈥揌ellman D. Blowfish", "completion": "D. Bcrypt is based on Blowfish (the b is a key hint here). AES and 3DES are both replacements for DES, while Diffie-Hellman is a protocol for key exchange."}
{"prompt": "Susan works in an organization that labels all removable media with the classification level of the data it contains, including public data. Why would Susan's employer label all media instead of labeling only the media that contains data that could cause harm if it was exposed? A. It is cheaper to order all prelabeled media. B. It prevents sensitive media from not being marked by mistake. C. It prevents reuse of public media for sensitive data. D. Labeling all media is required by HIPAA.", "completion": "B. Requiring all media to have a label means that when unlabeled media is found, it should immediately be considered suspicious. This helps to prevent mistakes that might leave sensitive data unlabeled. Prelabeled media is not necessarily cheaper (nor may it make sense to buy!), while reusing public media simply means that it must be classified based on the data it now contains. HIPAA does not have specific media labeling requirements."}
{"prompt": "Data stored in RAM is best characterized as what type of data? A. Data at rest B. Data in use C. Data in transit D. Data at large", "completion": "B. Data in use is data that is in a temporary storage location while an application or process is using it. Thus, data in memory is best described as data in use or ephemeral data. Data at rest is in storage, while data in transit is traveling over a network or other channel. Data at large is a made-up term."}
{"prompt": "What issue is the validation portion of the NIST SP 800-88 sample certificate of sanitization (shown here) intended to help prevent? A. Destruction B. Reuse C. Data remanence D. Attribution", "completion": "C. Validation processes are conducted to ensure that the sanitization process was completed, avoiding data remanence. A form like this one helps to ensure that each device has been checked and that it was properly wiped, purged, or sanitized. This can allow reuse, does not prevent destruction, and does not help with attribution, which is a concept used with encryption to prove who created or sent a file."}
{"prompt": "Why is declassification rarely chosen as an option for media reuse? A. Purging is sufficient for sensitive data. B. Sanitization is the preferred method of data removal. C. It is more expensive than new media and may still fail. D. Clearing is required first.", "completion": "C. Ensuring that data cannot be recovered is difficult, and the time and effort required to securely and completely wipe media as part of declassification can exceed the cost of new media. Sanitization, purging, and clearing may be part of declassification, but they are not reasons that it is not frequently chosen as an option for organizations with data security concerns."}
{"prompt": "Incineration, crushing, shredding, and disintegration all describe what stage in the lifecycle of media? A. Sanitization B. Degaussing C. Purging D. Destruction", "completion": "D. Destruction is the final stage in the lifecycle of media and can be done via disintegration, incineration, or a variety of other methods that result in the media and data being nonrecoverable. Sanitization is a combination of processes used when data is being removed from a system or media. Purging is an intense form of clearing, and degaussing uses strong magnetic fields to wipe data from magnetic media."}
{"prompt": "The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not include which of the following key elements? A. The need to collect information for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes B. The need to ensure that collection is limited to the information necessary to achieve the stated purpose C. The need to protect data against accidental destruction D. The need to encrypt information at rest", "completion": "D. The GDPR does include the need to collect information for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; the need to ensure that collection is limited to the information necessary to achieve the stated purpose; and the need to protect data against accidental destruction. It does not include a specific requirement to encrypt information at rest."}
{"prompt": "Why might an organization use unique screen backgrounds or designs on workstations that deal with data of different classification levels? A. To indicate the software version in use B. To promote a corporate message C. To promote availability D. To indicate the classification level of the data or system", "completion": "D. Visual indicators like a distinctive screen background can help employees remember what level of classification they are dealing with and thus the handling requirements that they are expected to follow."}
{"prompt": "Charles has been asked to downgrade the media used for storage of private data for his organization. What process should Charles follow? A. Degauss the drives, and then relabel them with a lower classification level. B. Pulverize the drives, and then reclassify them based on the data they contain. C. Follow the organization's purging process, and then downgrade and replace labels. D. Relabel the media, and then follow the organization's purging process to ensure that the media matches the label.", "completion": "C. If an organization allows media to be downgraded, the purging process should be followed, and then the media should be relabeled. Degaussing may be used for magnetic media but won,t handle all types of media. Pulverizing would destroy the media, preventing reuse, while relabeling first could lead to mistakes that result in media that hasn,t been purged entering use."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following tasks are not performed by a system owner per NIST SP 800-18? A. Develops a system security plan B. Establishes rules for appropriate use and protection of data C. Identifies and implements security controls D. Ensures that system users receive appropriate security training", "completion": "B. The data owner sets the rules for use and protection of data. The remaining options all describe tasks for the system owner, including implementation of security controls."}
{"prompt": "NIST SP 800-60 provides a process shown in the following diagram to assess information systems. What process does this diagram show? A. Selecting a standard and implementing it B. Categorizing and selecting controls C. Baselining and selecting controls D. Categorizing and sanitizing", "completion": "B. In the NIST SP 800-60 diagram, the process determines appropriate categorization levels resulting in security categorization and then uses that as an input to determine controls. Standard selection would occur at an organizational level, while baselining occurs when systems are configured to meet a baseline. Sanitization would require the intentional removal of data from machines or media."}
{"prompt": "Which letters on this diagram are locations where you might find data at rest? A. A, B, and C B. C and E C. A and E D. B, D, and F", "completion": "C. A and E can both be expected to have data at rest. C, the Internet, is an unknown, and the data can,t be guaranteed to be at rest. B, D, and F are all data in transit across network links."}
{"prompt": "What would be the best way to secure data at points B, D, and F? A. AES-256 B. SSL C. TLS D. 3DES", "completion": "C. B, D, and F all show network links. Of the answers provided, Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides the best security for data in motion. AES-256 and 3DES are both symmetric ciphers and are more likely to be used for data at rest. SSL has been replaced with TLS and should not be a preferred solution."}
{"prompt": "What is the best way to secure files that are sent from workstation A via the internet service (C) to remote server E? A. Use AES at rest at point A, and use TLS in transit via B and D. B. Encrypt the data files and send them. C. Use 3DES and TLS to provide double security. D. Use full disk encryption at A and E, and use SSL at B and D.", "completion": "B. Sending a file that is encrypted before it leaves means that exposure of the file in transit will not result in a confidentiality breach and the file will remain secure until decrypted at location E. Since answers A, C, and D do not provide any information about what happens at point C, they should be considered insecure, as the file may be at rest at point C in an unencrypted form."}
{"prompt": "Susan needs to provide a set of minimum security requirements for email. What steps should she recommend for her organization to ensure that the email remains secure? A. All email should be encrypted. B. All email should be encrypted and labeled. C. Sensitive email should be encrypted and labeled. D. Only highly sensitive email should be encrypted.", "completion": "C. Encrypting and labeling sensitive email will ensure that it remains confidential and can be identified. Performing these actions only on sensitive email will reduce the cost and effort of encrypting all email, allowing only sensitive email to be the focus of the organization,s efforts. Only encrypting highly sensitive email not only skips labeling but might expose other classifications of email that shouldn,t be exposed."}
{"prompt": "What term describes the process of reviewing baseline security controls and selecting only the controls that are appropriate for the IT system you are trying to protect? A. Standard creation B. CIS benchmarking C. Baselining D. Scoping", "completion": "D. Scoping is performed when you match baseline controls to the IT system you,re working to secure. Creation of standards is part of the configuration process and may involve the use of baselines. Baselining can mean the process of creating a security baseline or configuring systems to meet the baseline. CIS, the Center for Internet Security, provides a variety of security baselines."}
{"prompt": "What data role does a system that is used to process data have? A. Mission owner B. Data owner C. Data processor D. Custodian", "completion": "C. Systems used to process data are data processors. Data owners are typically CEOs or other very senior staff, custodians are granted rights to perform day-to-day tasks when handling data, and mission owners are typically program or information system owners."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following is not considered PII under U.S. federal government regulations? A. Name B. Social security number C. Student ID number D. ZIP code", "completion": "D. Personally identifiable information includes any information that can uniquely identify an individual. This would include name, Social Security number, and any other unique identifier (including a student ID number). ZIP code, by itself, does not uniquely identify an individual."}
{"prompt": "What type of health information is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act required to protect? A. PII B. PHI C. SHI D. HPHI", "completion": "B. Protected health information, or PHI, includes a variety of data in multiple formats, including oral and recorded data, such as that created or received by healthcare providers, employers, and life insurance providers. PHI must be protected by HIPAA. PII is personally identifiable information. SHI and HPHI are both made-up acronyms."}
{"prompt": "What encryption algorithm would provide strong protection for data stored on a USB thumb drive? A. TLS B. SHA1 C. AES D. DES", "completion": "C. AES is a strong symmetric cipher that is appropriate for use with data at rest. SHA1 is a cryptographic hash, while TLS is appropriate for data in motion. DES is an outdated and insecure symmetric encryption method."}
{"prompt": "Lauren's multinational company wants to ensure compliance with the EU GDPR. Which principle of the GDPR states that the individual should have the right to receive personal information concerning himself or herself and share it with another data controller? A. Onward transfer B. Data integrity C. Enforcement D. Data portability", "completion": "D. The principle of data portability says that the data subject has the right to receive personal information and to transfer that information to another data controller. The principle of data integrity states that data should be reliable and that information should not be used for purposes other than those that users are made aware of by notice and that they have accepted through choice. Enforcement is aimed at ensuring that compliance with principles is assured. Onward transfer limits transfers to other organizations that comply with the principles of notice and choice."}
{"prompt": "What is the best method to sanitize a solid-state drive (SSD)? A. Clearing B. Zero fill C. Disintegration D. Degaussing", "completion": "C. Due to problems with remnant data, the US National Security Agency requires physical destruction of SSDs. This process, known as disintegration, results in very small fragments via a shredding process. Zero fill wipes a drive by replacing data with zeros, degaussing uses magnets to wipe magnetic media, and clearing is the process of preparing media for reuse."}

{"prompt": "Fred is preparing to send backup tapes offsite to a secure third-party storage facility. What steps should Fred take before sending the tapes to that facility? A. Ensure that the tapes are handled the same way the original media would be handled based on their classification. B. Increase the classification level of the tapes because they are leaving the possession of the company. C. Purge the tapes to ensure that classified data is not lost. D. Decrypt the tapes in case they are lost in transit.", "completion": "A. Tapes are frequently exposed due to theft or loss in transit. That means that tapes that are leaving their normal storage facility should be handled according to the organization,s classification schemes and handling requirements. Purging the tapes would cause the loss of data, while increasing the classification level of the tapes. The tapes should be encrypted rather than decrypted."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following does not describe data in motion? A. Data on a backup tape that is being shipped to a storage facility B. Data in a TCP packet C. Data in an e-commerce transaction D. Data in files being copied between locations", "completion": "A. The correct answer is the tape that is being shipped to a storage facility. You might think that the tape in shipment is \"in motion,\" but the key concept is that the data is not being accessed and is instead in storage. Data in a TCP packet, in an e-commerce transaction, or in local RAM is in motion and is actively being used."}
{"prompt": "A new law is passed that would result in significant financial harm to your company if the data that it covers was stolen or inadvertently released. What should your organization do about this? A. Select a new security baseline. B. Relabel the data. C. Encrypt all of the data at rest and in transit. D. Review its data classifications and classify the data appropriately.", "completion": "D. When the value of data changes due to legal, compliance, or business reasons, reviewing classifications and reclassifying the data is an appropriate response. Once the review is complete, data can be reclassified and handled according to its classification level. Simply relabeling the data avoids the classification process and may not result in the data being handled appropriately. Similarly, selecting a new baseline or simply encrypting the data may not handle all of the needs that the changes affecting the data create."}

{"prompt": "What network topology is shown in the following image? A. A ring B. A bus C. A star D. A mesh", "completion": "A. A ring connects all systems like points on a circle. A ring topology was used with Token Ring networks, and a token was passed between systems around the ring to allow each system to communicate. More modern networks may be described as a ring but are only physically a ring and not logically using a ring topology."}
{"prompt": "What type of firewall design is shown in the diagram? A. A single-tier firewall B. A two-tier firewall C. A three-tier firewall D. A four-tier firewall", "completion": "B. The firewall in the diagram has two protected zones behind it, making it a two-tier firewall design."}
{"prompt": "If the VPN grants remote users the same access to network and system resources as local workstations have, what security issue should Chris raise? A. VPN users will not be able to access the web server. B. There is no additional security issue; the VPN concentrator's logical network location matches the logical network location of the workstations. C. Web server traffic is not subjected to stateful inspection. D. VPN users should only connect from managed PCs.", "completion": "D. Remote PCs that connect to a protected network need to comply with security settings and standards that match those required for the internal network. The VPN concentrator logically places remote users in the protected zone behind the firewall, but that means that user workstations (and users) must be trusted in the same way that local workstations are."}
{"prompt": "If Chris wants to stop cross-site scripting attacks against the web server, what is the best device for this purpose, and where should he put it? A. A firewall, location A B. An IDS, location A C. An IPS, location B D. A WAF, location C", "completion": "C. An intrusion protection system can scan traffic and stop both known and unknown attacks. A web application firewall, or WAF, is also a suitable technology, but placing it at location C would only protect from attacks via the organization鈥檚 VPN, which should only be used by trusted users. A firewall typically won鈥檛 have the ability to identify and stop cross-site scripting attacks, and IDS systems only monitor and don鈥檛 stop attacks."}
{"prompt": "Susan is deploying a routing protocol that maintains a list of destination networks with metrics that include the distance in hops to them and the direction traffic should be sent to them. What type of protocol is she using? A. A link-state protocol B. A link-distance protocol C. A destination metric protocol D. A distance-vector protocol", "completion": "D. Distance-vector protocols use metrics including the direction and distance in hops to remote networks to make decisions. A link-state routing protocol considers the shortest distance to a remote network. Destination metric and link-distance protocols don鈥檛 exist."}
{"prompt": "Ben has configured his network to not broadcast an SSID. Why might Ben disable SSID broadcast, and how could his SSID be discovered? A. Disabling SSID broadcast prevents attackers from discovering the encryption key. The SSID can be recovered from decrypted packets. B. Disabling SSID broadcast hides networks from unauthorized personnel. The SSID can be discovered using a wireless sniffer. C. Disabling SSID broadcast prevents issues with beacon frames. The SSID can be recovered by reconstructing the BSSID. D. Disabling SSID broadcast helps avoid SSID conflicts. The SSID can be discovered by attempting to connect to the network.", "completion": "B. Disabling SSID broadcast can help prevent unauthorized personnel from attempting to connect to the network. Since the SSID is still active, it can be discovered by using a wireless sniffer. Encryption keys are not related to SSID broadcast, beacon frames are used to broadcast the SSID, and it is possible to have multiple networks with the same SSID."}
{"prompt": "What network tool can be used to protect the identity of clients while providing Internet access by accepting client requests, altering the source addresses of the requests, mapping requests to clients, and sending the modified requests out to their destination? A. A gateway B. A proxy C. A router D. A firewall", "completion": "B. A proxy is a form of gateway that provide clients with a filtering, caching, or other service that protects their information from remote systems. A router connects networks, while a firewall uses rules to limit traffic permitted through it. A gateway translates between protocols."}
{"prompt": "During troubleshooting, Chris uses the nslookup command to check the IP address of a host he is attempting to connect to. The IP he sees in the response is not the IP that should resolve when the lookup is done. What type of attack has likely been conducted? A. DNS spoofing B. DNS poisoning C. ARP spoofing D. A Cain attack", "completion": "B. DNS poisoning occurs when an attacker changes the domain name to IP address mappings of a system to redirect traffic to alternate systems. DNS spoofing occurs when an attacker sends false replies to a requesting system, beating valid replies from the actual DNS server. ARP spoofing provides a false hardware address in response to queries about an IP, and Cain & Abel is a powerful Windows hacking tool, but a Cain attack is not a specific type of attack."}
{"prompt": "A remote access tool that copies what is displayed on a desktop PC to a remote computer is an example of what type of technology? A. Remote node operation B. Screen scraping C. Remote control D. RDP", "completion": "B. Screen scrapers copy the actual screen displayed and display it at a remote location. RDP provides terminal sessions without doing screen scraping, remote node operation is the same as dial-up access, and remote control is a means of controlling a remote system (screen scraping is a specialized subset of remote control)."}
{"prompt": "Which email security solution provides two major usage modes: (1) signed messages that provide integrity, sender authentication, and nonrepudiation; and (2) an enveloped message mode that provides integrity, sender authentication, and confidentiality? A. S/MIME B. MOSS C. PEM D. DKIM", "completion": "A. S/MIME supports both signed messages and a secure envelope method. While the functionality of S/MIME can be replicated with other tools, the secure envelope is an S/MIME-specific concept. MOSS, or MIME Object Security Services, and PEM can also both provide authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and nonrepudiation, while DKIM, or Domain Keys Identified Mail, is a domain validation tool."}
{"prompt": "During a security assessment, Jim discovers that the organization he is working with uses a multilayer protocol to handle SCADA systems and recently connected the SCADA network to the rest of the organization's production network. What concern should he raise about serial data transfers carried via TCP/IP? A. SCADA devices that are now connected to the network can now be attacked over the network. B. Serial data over TCP/IP cannot be encrypted. C. Serial data cannot be carried in TCP packets. D. TCP/IP's throughput can allow for easy denial of service attacks against serial devices.", "completion": "A. Multilayer protocols like DNP3 allow SCADA and other systems to use TCP/IP-based networks to communicate. Many SCADA devices were never designed to be exposed to a network, and adding them to a potentially insecure network can create significant risks. TLS or other encryption can be used on TCP packets, meaning that even serial data can be protected. Serial data can be carried via TCP packets because TCP packets don鈥檛 care about their content; it is simply another payload. Finally, TCP/IP does not have a specific throughput as designed, so issues with throughput are device-level issues."}
{"prompt": "What type of key does WEP use to encrypt wireless communications? A. An asymmetric key B. Unique key sets for each host C. A predefined shared static key D. Unique asymmetric keys for each host", "completion": "C. WEP has a very weak security model that relies on a single, predefined, shared static key. This means that modern attacks can break WEP encryption in less than a minute."}
{"prompt": "Arnold is receiving reports from end users that their internet connections are extremely slow. He looks at the firewall and determines that there are thousands of unexpected inbound connections per second arriving from all over the world. What type of attack is most likely occurring? A. A worm B. A denial of service attack C. A virus D. A smurf attack", "completion": "B. A denial of service attack is an attack that causes a service to fail or to be unavailable. Exhausting a system鈥檚 resources to cause a service to fail is a common form of denial of service attack. A worm is a self-replicating form of malware that propagates via a network, a virus is a type of malware that can copy itself to spread, and a smurf attack is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) that spoofs a victim鈥檚 IP address to systems using an IP broadcast, resulting in traffic from all of those systems to the target."}
{"prompt": "What speed and frequency range is used by 802.11n? A. 54 Mbps, 5 GHz B. 200+ Mbps, 5GHz C. 200+ Mbps, 2.4 and 5 GHz D. 1 Gbps, 5 GHz", "completion": "C. 802.11n can operate at speeds over 200 Mbps, and it can operate on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequency range. 802.11g operates at 54 Mbps using the 2.4 GHz frequency range, and 802.11ac is capable of 1 Gbps using the 5 GHz range. 802.11a and b are both outdated and are unlikely to be encountered in modern network installations."}
{"prompt": "The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) operate at what layer of the OSI model? A. Layer 1 B. Layer 2 C. Layer 3 D. Layer 4", "completion": "B. ARP and RARP operate at the Data Link layer, the second layer of the OSI model. Both protocols deal with physical hardware addresses, which are used above the Physical layer (layer 1) and below the Network layer (layer 3), thus falling at the Data Link layer."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following is a converged protocol that allows storage mounts over TCP, and which is frequently used as a lower-cost alternative to Fibre Channel? A. MPLS B. SDN C. VoIP D. iSCSI", "completion": "D. iSCSI is a converged protocol that allows location-independent file services over traditional network technologies. It costs less than traditional Fibre Channel. VoIP is Voice over IP, SDN is software-defined networking, and MPLS is Multiprotocol Label Switching, a technology that uses path labels instead of network addresses."}
{"prompt": "Chris is building an Ethernet network and knows that he needs to span a distance of more than 150 meters with his 1000BaseT network. What network technology should he use to help with this? A. Install a repeater or a concentrator before 100 meters. B. Use Category 7 cable, which has better shielding for higher speeds. C. Install a gateway to handle the distance. D. Use STP cable to handle the longer distance at high speeds.", "completion": "A. A repeater or concentrator will amplify the signal, ensuring that the 100-meter distance limitation of 1000BaseT is not an issue. A gateway would be useful if network protocols were changing, while Cat7 cable is appropriate for a 10Gbps network at much shorter distances. STP cable is limited to 155 Mbps and 100 meters, which would leave Chris with network problems."}
{"prompt": "What protocol is the messaging traffic most likely to use based on the diagram? A. SLACK B. HTTP C. SMTP D. HTTPS", "completion": "B. The use of TCP port 80 indicates that the messaging service is using the HTTP protocol. Slack is a messaging service that runs over HTTPS, which uses port 443. SMTP is an email protocol that uses port 25."}
{"prompt": "What security concern does sending internal communications from A to B raise? A. The firewall does not protect system B. B. System C can see the broadcast traffic from system A to B. C. It is traveling via an unencrypted protocol. D. Messaging does not provide nonrepudation.", "completion": "C. HTTP traffic is typically sent via TCP 80. Unencrypted HTTP traffic can be easily captured at any point between A and B, meaning that the messaging solution chosen does not provide confidentiality for the organization鈥檚 corporate communications."}
{"prompt": "How could Lauren's company best address a desire for secure messaging for users of internal systems A and C? A. Use a third-party messaging service. B. Implement and use a locally hosted service. C. Use HTTPS. D. Discontinue use of messaging and instead use email, which is more secure.", "completion": "B. If a business need requires messaging, using a local messaging server is the best option. This prevents traffic from traveling to a third-party server and can offer additional benefits such as logging, archiving, and control of security options like the use of encryption."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following drawbacks is a concern when multilayer protocols are allowed? A. A range of protocols may be used at higher layers. B. Covert channels are allowed. C. Filters cannot be bypassed. D. Encryption can't be incorporated at multiple layers.", "completion": "B. Multilayer protocols create three primary concerns for security practitioners: They can conceal covert channels (and thus covert channels are allowed), filters can be bypassed by traffic concealed in layered protocols, and the logical boundaries put in place by network segments can be bypassed under some circumstances. Multilayer protocols allow encryption at various layers and support a range of protocols at higher layers."}
{"prompt": "What network topology is shown in the following image? A. A ring B. A star C. A bus D. A mesh", "completion": "C. A bus can be linear or tree-shaped and connects each system to trunk or backbone cable. Ethernet networks operate on a bus topology."}
{"prompt": "Chris uses a cellular hot spot (modem) to provide internet access when he is traveling. If he leaves the hot spot connected to his PC while his PC is on his organization's corporate network, what security issue might he cause? A. Traffic may not be routed properly, exposing sensitive data. B. His system may act as a bridge from the internet to the local network. C. His system may be a portal for a reflected DDoS attack. D. Security administrators may not be able to determine his IP address if a security issue occurs.", "completion": "B. When a workstation or other device is connected simultaneously to both a secure and a nonsecure network like the Internet, it may act as a bridge, bypassing the security protections located at the edge of a corporate network. It is unlikely that traffic will be routed improperly leading to the exposure of sensitive data, as traffic headed to internal systems and networks is unlikely to be routed to the external network. Reflected DDoS attacks are used to hide identities rather than to connect through to an internal network, and security administrators of managed systems should be able to determine both the local and wireless IP addresses his system uses."}
{"prompt": "In her role as an information security professional, Susan has been asked to identify areas where her organization's wireless network may be accessible even though it isn't intended to be. What should Susan do to determine where her organization's wireless network is accessible? A. A site survey B. Warwalking C. Wardriving D. A design map", "completion": "A. Wardriving and warwalking are both processes used to locate wireless networks, but are not typically as detailed and thorough as a site survey, and design map is a made-up term."}
{"prompt": "The DARPA TCP/IP model's Application layer matches up to what three OSI model layers? A. Application, Presentation, and Transport. B. Presentation, Session, and Transport. C. Application, Presentation, and Session. D. There is not a direct match. The TCP model was created before the OSI model.", "completion": "C. The DARPA TCP/IP model was used to create the OSI model, and the designers of the OSI model made sure to map the OSI model layers to it. The Application layer of the TCP model maps to the Application, Presentation, and Session layers, while the TCP and OSI models both have a distinct Transport layer."}
{"prompt": "One of Susan's attacks during a penetration test involves inserting false ARP data into a system's ARP cache. When the system attempts to send traffic to the address it believes belongs to a legitimate system, it will instead send that traffic to a system she controls. What is this attack called? A. RARP flooding B. ARP cache poisoning C. A denial of ARP attack D. ARP buffer blasting", "completion": "B. ARP cache poisoning occurs when false ARP data is inserted into a system鈥檚 ARP cache, allowing the attacker to modify its behavior. RARP flooding, denial of ARP attacks, and ARP buffer blasting are all made-up terms."}
{"prompt": "Sue modifies her MAC address to one that is allowed on a network that uses MAC filtering to provide security. What is the technique Sue used, and what nonsecurity issue could her actions cause? A. Broadcast domain exploit, address conflict B. Spoofing, token loss C. Spoofing, address conflict D. Sham EUI creation, token loss", "completion": "C. The process of using a fake MAC (Media Access Control) address is called spoofing, and spoofing a MAC address already in use on the network can lead to an address collision, preventing traffic from reaching one or both systems. Tokens are used in token ring networks, which are outdated, and EUI refers to an Extended Unique Identifier, another term for MAC address, but token loss is still not the key issue. Broadcast domains refers to the set of machines a host can send traffic to via a broadcast message."}
{"prompt": "Jim's audit of a large organization's traditional PBX showed that Direct Inward System Access (DISA) was being abused by third parties. What issue is most likely to lead to this problem? A. The PBX was not fully patched. B. The dial-in modem lines use unpublished numbers. C. DISA is set up to only allow local calls. D. One or more users' access codes have been compromised.", "completion": "D. Direct Inward System Access uses access codes assigned to users to add a control layer for external access and control of the PBX. If the codes are compromised, attackers can make calls through the PBX or even control it. Not updating a PBX can lead to a range of issues, but this question is looking for a DISA issue. Allowing only local calls and using unpublished numbers are both security controls and might help keep the PBX more secure."}
{"prompt": "SMTP, HTTP, and SNMP all occur at what layer of the OSI model? A. Layer 4 B. Layer 5 C. Layer 6 D. Layer 7", "completion": "D. Application-specific protocols are handled at layer 7, the Application layer of the OSI model."}
{"prompt": "Lauren uses the ping utility to check whether a remote system is up as part of a penetration testing exercise. If she does not want to see her own ping packets, what protocol should she filter out from her packet sniffer's logs? A. UDP B. TCP C. IP D. ICMP", "completion": "D. Ping uses ICMP, the Internet Control Message Protocol, to determine whether a system responds and how many hops there are between the originating system and the remote system. Lauren simply needs to filter out ICMP to not see her pings."}
{"prompt": "Lauren wants to provide port-based authentication on her network to ensure that clients must authenticate before using the network. What technology is an appropriate solution for this requirement? A. 802.11a B. 802.3 C. 802.15.1 D. 802.1x", "completion": "D. 802.1x provides port-based authentication and can be used with technologies like EAP, the Extensible Authentication Protocol. 802.11a is a wireless standard, 802.3 is the standard for Ethernet, and 802.15.1 was the original Bluetooth IEEE standard."}
{"prompt": "Ben has deployed a 1000BaseT 1 gigabit network and needs to run a cable to another building. If Ben is running his link directly from a switch to another switch in that building, what is the maximum distance Ben can cover according to the 1000BaseT specification? A. 2 kilometers B. 500 meters C. 185 meters D. 100 meters", "completion": "D. 1000BaseT is capable of a 100-meter run according to its specifications. For longer distances, a fiber-optic cable is typically used in modern networks."}
{"prompt": "Jim is building the network for a remote site that only has ISDN as an option for connectivity. What type of ISDN should he look for to get the maximum speed possible? A. BRI B. BPRI C. PRI D. D channel", "completion": "C. PRI, or Primary Rate Interface, can use between 2 and 23 64 Kbps channels, with a maximum potential bandwidth of 1.544 Mbps. Actual speeds will be lower due to the D channel, which can鈥檛 be used for actual data transmission, but PRI beats BRI鈥檚 two B channels paired with a D channel for 144 Kbps of bandwidth."}
{"prompt": "SPIT attacks target what technology? A. Virtualization platforms B. Web services C. VoIP systems D. Secure Process Internal Transfers", "completion": "C. SPIT stands for Spam over Internet Telephony and targets VoIP systems."}
{"prompt": "What does a bluesnarfing attack target? A. Data on IBM systems B. An outbound phone call via Bluetooth C. 802.11b networks D. Data from a Bluetooth-enabled device", "completion": "D. Bluesnarfing targets the data or information on Bluetooth-enabled devices. Bluejacking occurs when attackers send unsolicited messages via Bluetooth."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following options includes standards or protocols that exist in layer 6 of the OSI model? A. NFS, SQL, and RPC B. TCP, UDP, and TLS C. JPEG, ASCII, and MIDI D. HTTP, FTP, and SMTP", "completion": "C. Layer 6, the Presentation layer, transforms data from the Application layer into formats that other systems can understand by formatting and standardizing the data. That means that standards like JPEG, ASCII, and MIDI are used at the Presentation layer for data. TCP, UDP, and TLS are used at the Transport layer; NFS, SQL, and RPC operate at the Session layer; and HTTP, FTP, and SMTP are Application layer protocols."}
{"prompt": "What network topology is shown here? A. A ring B. A bus C. A star D. A mesh", "completion": "D. Fully connected mesh networks provide each system with a direct physical link to every other system in the mesh. This is very expensive but can provide performance advantages for specific types of computational work."}
{"prompt": "There are four common VPN protocols. Which group listed contains all of the common VPN protocols? A. PPTP, LTP, L2TP, IPsec B. PPP, L2TP, IPsec, VNC C. PPTP, L2F, L2TP, IPsec D. PPTP, L2TP, IPsec, SPAP", "completion": "C. PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPsec are the most common VPN protocols. TLS is also used for an increasingly large percentage of VPN connections and may appear at some point in the CISSP exam. PPP is a dial-up protocol, LTP is not a protocol, and SPAP is the Shiva Password Authentication Protocol sometimes used with PPTP."}
{"prompt": "What network technology is best described as a token-passing network that uses a pair of rings with traffic flowing in opposite directions? A. A ring topology B. Token Ring C. FDDI D. SONET", "completion": "C. FDDI, or Fiber Distributed Data Interface, is a token-passing network that uses a pair of rings with traffic flowing in opposite directions. It can bypass broken segments by dropping the broken point and using the second, unbroken ring to continue to function. Token Ring also uses tokens, but it does not use a dual loop. SONET is a protocol for sending multiple optical streams over fiber, and a ring topology is a design, not a technology"}
{"prompt": "Which OSI layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and interface standards? A. The Transport layer B. The Device layer C. The Physical layer D. The Data Link layer", "completion": "C. The Physical layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and standards that allow control of throughput, handling line noise, and a variety of other electrical interface and signaling requirements. The OSI layer doesn't have a Device layer. The Transport layer connects the Network and Session layers, and the Data Link layer packages packets from the network layer for transmission and receipt by devices operating on the Physical layer."}
{"prompt": "Ben is designing a Wi-Fi network and has been asked to choose the most secure option for the network. Which wireless security standard should he choose? A. WPA2 B. WPA C. WEP D. AES", "completion": "A. WPA2, the replacement for WPA, does not suffer from the security issues that WEP, the original wireless security protocol, and WPA, its successor, both suffer from. AES is used in WPA2 but is not specifically a wireless security standard."}
{"prompt": "If your organization needs to allow attachments in email to support critical business processes, what are the two best options for helping to avoid security problems caused by attachments? A. Train your users and use antimalware tools. B. Encrypt your email and use antimalware tools. C. Train your users and require S/MIME for all email. D. Use S/MIME by default and remove all ZIP (.zip) file attachments.", "completion": "A. User awareness is one of the most important tools when dealing with attachments. Attachments are often used as a vector for malware, and aware users can help prevent successful attacks by not opening the attachments. Antimalware tools, including antivirus software, can help detect known threats before users even see the attachments. Encryption, including tools like S/MIME, won't help prevent attachment-based security problems, and removing ZIP file attachments will only stop malware that is sent via those ZIP files."}
{"prompt": "Segmentation, sequencing, and error checking all occur at what layer of the OSI model that is associated with SSL, TLS, and UDP? A. The Transport layer B. The Network layer C. The Session layer D. The Presentation layer", "completion": "A. The Transport layer provides logical connections between devices, including end-toend transport services to ensure that data is delivered. Transport layer protocols include TCP, UDP, SSL, and TLS."}
{"prompt": "The Windows ipconfig command displays the following information: BC-5F-F4-7B-4B-7D What term describes this, and what information can usually be gathered from it? A. The IP address, the network location of the system B. The MAC address, the network interface card's manufacturer C. The MAC address, the media type in use D. The IPv6 client ID, the network interface card's manufacturer", "completion": "B. Machine Access Control (MAC) addresses are the hardware address the machine uses for layer 2 communications. The MAC addresses include an organizationally unique identifier (OUI), which identifies the manufacturer. MAC addresses can be changed, so this is not a guarantee of accuracy, but under normal circumstances you can tell what manufacturer made the device by using the MAC address."}
{"prompt": "Chris has been asked to choose between implementing PEAP and LEAP for wireless authentication. What should he choose, and why? A. LEAP, because it fixes problems with TKIP, resulting in stronger security B. PEAP, because it implements CCMP for security C. LEAP, because it implements EAP-TLS for end-to-end session encryption D. PEAP, because it can provide a TLS tunnel that encapsulates EAP methods, protecting the entire session", "completion": "D. PEAP provides encryption for EAP methods and can provide authentication. It does not implement CCMP, which was included in the WPA2 standard. LEAP is dangerously insecure and should not be used due to attack tools that have been available since the early 2000s."}
{"prompt": "Ben is troubleshooting a network and discovers that the NAT router he is connected to has the 192.168.x.x subnet as its internal network and that its external IP is 192.168.1.40. What problem is he encountering? A. 192.168.x.x is a nonroutable network and will not be carried to the Internet. B. 192.168.1.40 is not a valid address because it is reserved by RFC 1918. C. Double NATing is not possible using the same IP range. D. The upstream system is unable to de-encapsulate his packets and he needs to use PAT instead.", "completion": "C. Double NATing isn't possible with the same IP range; the same IP addresses cannot appear inside and outside a NAT router. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved, but only so they are not used and routable on the Internet, and changing to PAT would not fix the issue."}
{"prompt": "What is the default subnet mask for a Class B network? A. 255.0.0.0 B. 255.255.0.0 C. 255.254.0.0 D. 255.255.255.0", "completion": "B. A Class B network holds 2^16 systems, and its default network mask is 255.255.0.0."}
{"prompt": "Jim's organization uses a traditional PBX for voice communication. What is the most common security issue that its internal communications are likely to face, and what should he recommend to prevent it? A. Eavesdropping, encryption B. Man-in-the-middle attacks, end-to-end encryption C. Eavesdropping, physical security D. Wardialing, deploy an IPS", "completion": "C. Traditional private branch exchange (PBX) systems are vulnerable to eavesdropping because voice communications are carried directly over copper wires. Since standard telephones don't provide encryption (and you're unlikely to add encrypted phones unless you're the NSA), physically securing access to the lines and central connection points is the best strategy available."}
{"prompt": "What common security issue is often overlooked with cordless phones? A. Their signal is rarely encrypted and thus can be easily monitored. B. They use unlicensed frequencies. C. They can allow attackers access to wireless networks. D. They are rarely patched and are vulnerable to malware.", "completion": "A. Most cordless phones don't use encryption, and even modern phones that use DECT (which does provide encryption) have already been cracked. This means that a determined attacker can almost always eavesdrop on cordless phones, and makes them a security risk if they're used for confidential communication."}
{"prompt": "Lauren's organization has deployed VoIP phones on the same switches that the desktop PCs are on. What security issue could this create, and what solution would help? A. VLAN hopping; use physically separate switches. B. VLAN hopping; use encryption. C. Caller ID spoofing; MAC filtering. D. Denial of service attacks; use a firewall between networks.", "completion": "A. VLAN hopping between the voice and computer VLANs can be accomplished when devices share the same switch infrastructure. Using physically separate switches can prevent this attack. Encryption won't help with VLAN hopping because it relies on header data that the switch needs to read (and this is unencrypted), while Caller ID spoofing is an inherent problem with VoIP systems. A denial of service is always a possibility, but it isn't specifically a VoIP issue and a firewall may not stop the problem if it's on a port that must be allowed through."}
{"prompt": "Which one of the following rules is not shown in the rulebase but will be enforced by the firewall? A. Stealth B. Implicit deny C. Connection proxy D. Egress filter", "completion": "B. All stateful inspection firewalls enforce an implicit deny rule as the final rule of the rulebase. It is designed to drop all inbound traffic that was not accepted by an earlier rule. Stealth rules hide the firewall from external networks, but they are not included by default. This firewall does not contain any egress filtering rules, and egress filtering is not enforced by default. Connection proxying is an optional feature of stateful inspection firewalls and would not be enforced without a rule explicitly implementing it."}
{"prompt": "What type of server is running at IP address 10.1.0.26? A. Email B. Web C. FTP D. Database", "completion": "A. SMTP uses ports 25 and 465. The presence of an inbound rule allowing SMTP traffic indicates that this is an email server."}
{"prompt": "The system at 15.246.10.1 attempts HTTP and HTTPS connections to the web server running at 10.1.0.50. Which one of the following statements is true about that connection? A. Both connections will be allowed. B. Both connections will be blocked. C. The HTTP connection will be allowed, and the HTTPS connection will be blocked. D. The HTTP connection will be blocked, and the HTTPS connection will be allowed.", "completion": "C. The HTTP connection will be allowed, despite the presence of rule #2, because it matches rule #1. The HTTPS connection will be blocked because there is no rule allowing HTTPS connections to this server."}
{"prompt": "What value should be used to fill in the source port for rule #3? A. 25 B. 465 C. 80 D. Any", "completion": "D. The firewall should be configured to accept inbound connections from any port selected by the source system. The vast majority of inbound firewall rules allow access from any source port."}
{"prompt": "Data streams occur at what three layers of the OSI model? A. Application, Presentation, and Session B. Presentation, Session, and Transport C. Physical, Data Link, and Network D. Data Link, Network, and Transport", "completion": "A. Data streams are associated with the Application, Presentation, and Session layers. Once they reach the Transport layer, they become segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). From there, they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer, and bits at the Physical layer."}
{"prompt": "Chris needs to design a firewall architecture that can support a DMZ, a database, and a private internal network in a secure manner that separates each function. What type of design should he use, and how many firewalls does he need? A. A four-tier firewall design with two firewalls B. A two-tier firewall design with three firewalls C. A three-tier firewall design with at least one firewall D. A single-tier firewall design with three firewalls", "completion": "C. A three-tier design separates three distinct protected zones and can be accomplished with a single firewall that has multiple interfaces. Single- and two-tier designs don't support the number of protected networks needed in this scenario, while a four-tier design would provide a tier that isn't needed."}
{"prompt": "Lauren's networking team has been asked to identify a technology that will allow them to dynamically change the organization's network by treating the network like code. What type of architecture should she recommend? A. A network that follows the 5-4-3 rule B. A converged network C. A software-defined network D. A hypervisor-based network", "completion": "C. Software-defined networking provides a network architecture that can be defined and configured as code or software. This will allow Lauren's team to quickly change the network based on organizational requirements. The 5-4-3 rule is an old design rule for networks that relied on repeaters or hubs. A converged network carries multiple types of traffic like voice, video, and data. A hypervisor-based network may be software defined, but it could also use traditional network devices running as virtual machines."}
{"prompt": "Cable modems, ISDN, and DSL are all examples of what type of technology? A. Baseband B. Broadband C. Digital D. Broadcast", "completion": "B. ISDN, cable modems, DSL, and T1 and T3 lines are all examples of broadband technology that can support multiple simultaneous signals. They are analog, not digital, and are not broadcast technologies."}
{"prompt": "What type of firewall design is shown in the following image? A. Single tier B. Two tier C. Three tier D. Next generation", "completion": "A. A single-tier firewall deployment is very simple and does not offer useful design options like a DMZ or separate transaction subnets."}
{"prompt": "During a review of her organization's network, Angela discovered that it was suffering from broadcast storms and that contractors, guests, and organizational administrative staff were on the same network segment. What design change should Angela recommend? A. Require encryption for all users. B. Install a firewall at the network border. C. Enable spanning tree loop detection. D. Segment the network based on functional requirements.", "completion": "D. Network segmentation can reduce issues with performance as well as diminish the chance of broadcast storms by limiting the number of systems in a segment. This decreases broadcast traffic visible to each system and can reduce congestion. Segmentation can also help provide security by separating functional groups who don't need to be able to access each other's systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and outbound traffic, not cross-network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues. Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm!"}
{"prompt": "ICMP, RIP, and network address translation all occur at what layer of the OSI model? A. Layer 1 B. Layer 2 C. Layer 3 D. Layer 4", "completion": "C. ICMP, RIP, and network address translation all occur at layer 3, the Network layer."}
{"prompt": "The IDS Ben is responsible for is used to monitor communications in the data center using a mirrored port on the data center switch. What traffic will Ben see once the majority of servers in the data center have been virtualized? A. The same traffic he currently sees B. All inter-VM traffic C. Only traffic sent outside the VM environment D. All inter-hypervisor traffic", "completion": "C. One of the visibility risks of virtualization is that communication between servers and systems using virtual interfaces can occur \"inside\" the virtual environment. This means that visibility into traffic in the virtualization environment has to be purpose-built as part of its design. Option D is correct but incomplete because inter-hypervisor traffic isn't the only traffic the IDS will see."}
{"prompt": "The VM administrators recommend enabling cut and paste between virtual machines. What security concern should Ben raise about this practice? A. It can cause a denial of service condition. B. It can serve as a covert channel. C. It can allow viruses to spread. D. It can bypass authentication controls.", "completion": "B. Cut and paste between virtual machines can bypass normal network-based data loss prevention tools and monitoring tools like an IDS or IPS. Thus, it can act as a covert channel, allowing the transport of data between security zones. So far, cut and paste has not been used as a method for malware spread in virtual environments and has not been associated with denial of service attacks. Cut and paste requires users to be logged in and does not bypass authentication requirements."}
{"prompt": "Ben is concerned about exploits that allow VM escape. What option should Ben suggest to help limit the impact of VM escape exploits? A. Separate virtual machines onto separate physical hardware based on task or data types. B. Use VM escape detection tools on the underlying hypervisor. C. Restore machines to their original snapshots on a regular basis. D. Use a utility like Tripwire to look for changes in the virtual machines.", "completion": "A. While virtual machine escape has only been demonstrated in laboratory environments, the threat is best dealt with by limiting what access to the underlying hypervisor can prove to a successful tracker. Segmenting by data types or access levels can limit the potential impact of a hypervisor compromise. If attackers can access the underlying system, restricting the breach to only similar data types or systems will limit the impact. Escape detection tools are not available on the market, restoring machines to their original snapshots will not prevent the exploit from occurring again, and Tripwire detects file changes and is unlikely to catch exploits that escape the virtual machines themselves."}
{"prompt": "WPA2's Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Mode Protocol (CCMP) is based on which common encryption scheme? A. DES B. 3DES C. AES D. TLS", "completion": "C. WPA2's CCMP encryption scheme is based on AES. As of the writing of this book, there have not been any practical real-world attacks against WPA2. DES has been successfully broken, and neither 3DES nor TLS is used for WPA2."}
{"prompt": "When a host on an Ethernet network detects a collision and transmits a jam signal, what happens next? A. The host that transmitted the jam signal is allowed to retransmit while all other hosts pause until that transmission is received successfully. B. All hosts stop transmitting, and each host waits a random period of time before attempting to transmit again. C. All hosts stop transmitting, and each host waits a period of time based on how recently it successfully transmitted. D. Hosts wait for the token to be passed and then resume transmitting data as they pass the token.", "completion": "B. Ethernet networks use Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/ CD) technology. When a collision is detected and a jam signal is sent, hosts wait a random period of time before attempting retransmission."}
{"prompt": "What is the speed of a T3 line? A. 128 kbps B. 1.544 Mbps C. 44.736 Mbps D. 155 Mbps", "completion": "C. A T3 (DS-3) line is capable of 44.736 Mbps. This is often referred to as 45 Mbps. A T1 is 1.544 Mbps, ATM is 155 Mbps, and ISDN is often 64 or 128 Kbps."}
{"prompt": "What type of firewall design does the following image show? A. A single-tier firewall B. A two-tier firewall C. A three-tier firewall D. A fully protected DMZ firewall", "completion": "B. A two-tier firewall uses a firewall with multiple interfaces or multiple firewalls in series. This image shows a firewall with two protected interfaces, with one used for a DMZ and one used for a protected network. This allows traffic to be filtered between each of the zones (Internet, DMZ, and private network)."}
{"prompt": "What challenge is most common for endpoint security system deployments? A. Compromises B. The volume of data C. Monitoring encrypted traffic on the network D. Handling non-TCP protocols", "completion": "B. Endpoint security solutions face challenges due to the sheer volume of data that they can create. When each workstation is generating data about events, this can be a massive amount of data. Endpoint security solutions should reduce the number of compromises when properly implemented, and they can also help by monitoring traffic after it is decrypted on the local host. Finally, non-TCP protocols are relatively uncommon on modern networks, making this a relatively rare concern for endpoint security system implementations."}
{"prompt": "What type of address is 127.0.0.1? A. A public IP address B. An RFC 1918 address C. An APIPA address D. A loopback address", "completion": "D. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address and will resolve to the local machine. Public addresses are non-RFC 1918, non-reserved addresses. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved and include ranges like 10.x.x.x. An APIPA address is a self-assigned address used when a DHCP server cannot be found."}
{"prompt": "Susan is writing a best practices statement for her organizational users who need to use Bluetooth. She knows that there are many potential security issues with Bluetooth and wants to provide the best advice she can. Which of the following sets of guidance should Susan include? A. Use Bluetooth's built-in strong encryption, change the default PIN on your device, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. B. Use Bluetooth only for those activities that are not confidential, change the default PIN on your device, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. C. Use Bluetooth's built-in strong encryption, use extended (8 digit or longer) Bluetooth PINs, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use. D. Use Bluetooth only for those activities that are not confidential, use extended (8 digit or longer) Bluetooth PINs, turn off discovery mode, and turn off Bluetooth when it's not in active use.", "completion": "B. Since Bluetooth doesn't provide strong encryption, it should only be used for activities that are not confidential. Bluetooth PINs are four-digit codes that often default to 0000. Turning it off and ensuring that your devices are not in discovery mode can help prevent Bluetooth attacks."}
{"prompt": "What type of networking device is most commonly used to assign endpoint systems to VLANs? A. Firewall B. Router C. Switch D. Hub", "completion": "C. The assignment of endpoint systems to VLANs is normally performed by a network switch."}
{"prompt": "Steve has been tasked with implementing a network storage protocol over an IP network. What storage-centric converged protocol is he likely to use in his implementation? A. MPLS B. FCoE C. SDN D. VoIP", "completion": "B. Fibre Channel over Ethernet allows Fibre Channel communications over Ethernet networks, allowing existing high-speed networks to be used to carry storage traffic. This avoids the cost of a custom cable plant for a Fibre Channel implementation. MPLS, or Multiprotocol Label Switching, is used for high performance networking; VoIP is Voice over IP; and SDN is software-defined networking."}
{"prompt": "What type of network device modulates between an analog carrier signal and digital information for computer communications? A. A bridge B. A router C. A brouter D. A modem", "completion": "D. A modem (MOdulator/DEModulator) modulates between an analog carrier like a phone line and digital communications like those used between computers. While modems aren't in heavy use in most areas, they are still in place for system control and remote system contact and in areas where phone lines are available but other forms of communication are too expensive or not available."}
{"prompt": "A denial of service (DoS) attack that sends fragmented TCP packets is known as what kind of attack? A. Christmas tree B. Teardrop C. Stack killer D. Frag grenade", "completion": "B. A teardrop attack uses fragmented packets to target a flaw in how the TCP stack on a system handles fragment reassembly. If the attack is successful, the TCP stack fails, resulting in a denial of service. Christmas tree attacks set all of the possible TCP flags on a packet, thus \"lighting it up like a Christmas tree.\" Stack killer and frag grenade attacks are made-up answers."}
{"prompt": "Phillip maintains a modem bank in support of several legacy services used by his organization. Which one of the following protocols is most appropriate for this purpose? A. SLIP B. SLAP C. PPTP D. PPP", "completion": "D. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is used for dial-up connections for modems, IDSN, Frame Relay, and other technologies. It replaced SLIP in almost all cases. PPTP is the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol used for VPNs, and SLAP is not a protocol at all!"}
{"prompt": "One of the findings that Jim made when performing a security audit was the use of non-IP protocols in a private network. What issue should Jim point out that may result from the use of these non-IP protocols? A. They are outdated and cannot be used on modern PCs. B. They may not be able to be filtered by firewall devices. C. They may allow Christmas tree attacks. D. IPX extends on the IP protocol and may not be supported by all TCP stacks.", "completion": "B. While non-IP protocols like IPX/SPX, NetBEUI, and AppleTalk are rare in modern networks, they can present a challenge because many firewalls are not capable of filtering them. This can create risks when they are necessary for an application or system's function  because they may have to be passed without any inspection. Christmas tree attacks set all of the possible flags on a TCP packet (and are thus related to an IP protocol), IPX is not an IP-based protocol, and while these protocols are outdated, there are ways to make even modern PCs understand them."}
{"prompt": "Angela needs to choose between EAP, PEAP, and LEAP for secure authentication. Which authentication protocol should she choose and why? A. EAP, because it provides strong encryption by default B. LEAP, because it provides frequent reauthentication and changing of WEP keys C. PEAP, because it provides encryption and doesn't suffer from the same vulnerabilities that LEAP does D. None of these options can provide secure authentication, and an alternate solution should be chosen.", "completion": "C. Of the three answers, PEAP is the best solution. It encapsulates EAP in a TLS tunnel, providing strong encryption. LEAP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that was originally designed to help deal with problems in WEP. LEAP's protections have been defeated, making it a poor choice."}
{"prompt": "Lauren has been asked to replace her organization's PPTP implementation with an L2TP implementation for security reasons. What is the primary security reason that L2TP would replace PPTP? A. L2TP can use IPsec. B. L2TP creates a point-to-point tunnel, avoiding multipoint issues. C. PPTP doesn't support EAP. D. PPTP doesn't properly encapsulate PPP packets.", "completion": "A. L2TP can use IPsec to provide encryption of traffic, ensuring confidentiality of the traffic carried via an L2TP VPN. PPTP sends the initial packets of a session in plaintext, potentially including usernames and hashed passwords. PPTP does support EAP and was designed to encapsulate PPP packets. All VPNs are point to point, and multipoint issues are not a VPN problem."}
{"prompt": "Jim is building a research computing system that benefits from being part of a full mesh topology between systems. In a five-node full mesh topology design, how many connections will an individual node have? A. Two B. Three C. Four D. Five", "completion": "C. A full mesh topology directly connects each machine to every other machine on the network. For five systems, this means four connections per system."}
{"prompt": "What topology correctly describes Ethernet? A. A ring B. A star C. A mesh D. A bus", "completion": "D. Ethernet uses a bus topology. While devices may be physically connected to a switch in a physical topology that looks like a star, systems using Ethernet can all transmit on the bus simultaneously, possibly leading to collisions."}
{"prompt": "What type of attack is most likely to occur after a successful ARP spoofing attempt? A. A DoS attack B. A Trojan C. A replay attack D. A man-in-the-middle attack", "completion": "D. ARP spoofing is often done to replace a target's cache entry for a destination IP, allowing the attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. A denial of service attack would be aimed at disrupting services rather than spoofing an ARP response, a replay attack will involve existing sessions, and a Trojan is malware that is disguised in a way that makes it look harmless."}
{"prompt": "What speed is Category 3 UTP cable rated for? A. 5 Mbps B. 10 Mbps C. 100 Mbps D. 1000 Mbps", "completion": "B. Category 3 UTP cable is primarily used for phone cables and was also used for early Ethernet networks where it provided 10 Mbps of throughput. Cat 5 cable provides 100 Mbps (and 1000 Mbps if it is Cat 5e). Cat 6 cable can also provide 1000 Mbps."}
{"prompt": "What issue occurs when data transmitted over one set of wires is picked up by another set of wires? A. Magnetic interference B. Crosstalk C. Transmission absorption D. Amplitude modulation", "completion": "B. Crosstalk occurs when data transmitted on one set of wires is picked up on another set of wires. Interference like this is electromagnetic rather than simply magnetic, transmission absorption is a made-up term, and amplitude modulation is how AM radio works."}
{"prompt": "What two key issues with the implementation of RC4 make Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) even weaker than it might otherwise be? A. Its use of a static common key and client-set encryption algorithms B. Its use of a static common key and a limited number of initialization vectors C. Its use of weak asymmetric keys and a limited number of initialization vectors D. Its use of a weak asymmetric key and client-set encryption algorithms", "completion": "B. WEP's implementation of RC4 is weakened by its use of a static common key and a limited number of initialization vectors. It does not use asymmetric encryption, and clients do not select encryption algorithms."}
{"prompt": "Chris is setting up a hotel network and needs to ensure that systems in each room or suite can connect to each other, but systems in other suites or rooms cannot. At the same time, he needs to ensure that all systems in the hotel can reach the internet. What solution should he recommend as the most effective business solution? A. Per-room VPNs B. VLANs C. Port security D. Firewalls", "completion": "B. VLANs can be used to logically separate groups of network ports while still providing access to an uplink. Per-room VPNs would create significant overhead for support as well as create additional expenses. Port security is used to limit what systems can connect to ports, but it doesn't provide network security between systems. Finally, while firewalls might work, they would add additional expense and complexity without adding any benefits over a VLAN solution."}
{"prompt": "During a forensic investigation, Charles is able to determine the Media Access Control address of a system that was connected to a compromised network. Charles knows that MAC addresses are tied back to a manufacturer or vendor and are part of the fingerprint of the system. To which OSI layer does a MAC address belong? A. The Application layer B. The Session layer C. The Physical layer D. The Data Link layer", "completion": "D. MAC addresses and their organizationally unique identifiers are used at the Data Link layer to identify systems on a network. The Application and Session layers don't care about physical addresses, while the Physical layer involves electrical connectivity and handling physical interfaces rather than addressing."}
{"prompt": "Ben knows that his organization wants to be able to validate the identity of other organizations based on their domain name when receiving and sending email. What tool should Ben recommend? A. PEM B. S/MIME C. DKIM D. MOSS", "completion": "C. Domain Keys Identified Mail, or DKIM, is designed to allow assertions of domain identity to validate email. S/MIME, PEM, and MOSS are all solutions that can provide authentication, integrity, nonrepudiation, and confidentiality, depending on how they are used."}
